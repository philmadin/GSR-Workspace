Early access for the hotly anticipated Xbox Game Pass is now live for Xbox Live Gold members, with the full service launching June 1, 2017.&nbsp;<p></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p></p><p>What is it you ask? Think Netflix for gaming, but without live streaming. For $10.95AUD p/month you get access to over 100 titles spread across the Xbox One and Xbox 360 that you can download directly to your console. The current spread of games ranges from<i> Halo 5</i> and <i>Payday 2</i> to the <i>Bioshock </i>series and even <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i> - and Microsoft is planning on adding more titles each month.</p><p></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Xbox Live Gold members can start a free 14-day trial right now, with subscriptions being available online&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-AU/games/xbox-game-pass">here</a><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">. Subscriptions will be made available to all other Live account holders from June 1.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Game Pass members can also purchase any Xbox One games in the catalogue with a 20% discount if you want to add it permanently to your library (10% for add-ons).&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">&nbsp;You can cancel the subscription at&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">any time</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">, and while you will lose access to the games you will not lose your progress from playing.</span></p><p></p><p><p><br></p><p><br></p></p><p></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">With so many games available for download so far, it will be interesting to see just how quickly local storage disappears as we download more and more games through the service. Thankfully Microsoft has been kind enough to trust us to use external hard drives for storage, so keep in mind that that option is there if you need it.</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">This isn't the first time we've seen subscription based gaming - other services such as OnLive, PlayStation Now and EA Access have tried and mostly failed to make such a service work. Initial reports of Xbox Game Pass are promising, however, and if Microsoft can continually expand their catalogue with new and exciting games, we may very well be onto a winner. Content is always king.</span></p>
