Working in collaboration with child development experts Martine Curtat-Cadet and Cristina Do Carmo De Sousa Gomes, Ubisoft has just announced that their newest instalment of <i>Just Dance</i> will feature a 'Kids' Mode'.&nbsp;<p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The dedicated mode was developed to assist in the improvement of kids' motor skills while reinforcing positive and supportive feedback. The fresh new 'Kids' Mode' will feature eight easy choreographies and cool characters in universes children really love. The game's interface has also been adapted with simplified text, an optional continuous or random play mode and a generous scoring system.&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">As Curtat-Cadet explains: "Children aged between three and six quite often have difficulties reproducing fast and complex movements. The steps we have developed in these choreographies are associated with intentions that correspond to action verbs like running, climbing, flying, catching. Inevitably the child will learn and will integrate the choreographies naturally and not by imitation. Additionally, dancing really helps children to acquire scholarly skills like writing, reading and art as well."</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><i>Just Dance 2018</i> will also feature in the main mode "How Far I'll Go", the hit track from Disney's <i>Moana</i>. The game is set to be released on Nintendo Switch, Wii U, Wii, Xbox One, Xbox 360, PS4 and PS3 on October 26th.</p><p></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Watch the gameplay below:</p><p></p>
