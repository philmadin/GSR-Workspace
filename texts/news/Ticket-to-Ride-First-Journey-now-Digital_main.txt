<p>If you're like me and appreciate gaming of the board variety, then you may have heard of a game called <i>Ticket to Ride: First Journey</i>. Published back in 2004 by Alan R. Moon, the game has won multiple awards in multiple categories.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">The concept is simple: compete with friends to successfully complete the most railway routes on a map through the collecting and playing of cards.</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Thanks to Asmodee Digital, <i>Ticket to Ride</i> is now available in digital form for iOS, Android and PC via Steam. Play in solo mode against AI opponents, or with up to three friends in the 'pass and play' mode. The digital version comes with the European and North American maps, and also features unlockable rewards to build your geographical knowledge as you connect the cities.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The game may look and feel like it is aimed at kids, but there is more than enough for the serious of us players to enjoy too. Very rarely does a game satisfy young and old, casual and competitive alike -&nbsp;<i>Ticket to Ride</i>&nbsp;is certainly worth a look.&nbsp;</p>
