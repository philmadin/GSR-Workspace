<br>In <i>Lara Croft GO</i> for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita, Lara Croft will use her wits and weapons as she delves further into dangerous chasms, filled with mystery, artifacts and peril. Featuring the ambient and zen-like music, soothing art style and didactic turn-based puzzle solving that made the game a critical and commercial success on mobile platforms last year, the PlayStation 4 and Vita versions include cross-buy and cross-saving so you can purchase and play it on both platforms without losing progress.  <br><br>
