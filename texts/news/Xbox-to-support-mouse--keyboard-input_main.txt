The corporate vice president of Xbox &amp; Windows gaming platform at Microsoft, Mike Ybarra, revealed during a Q&amp;A session at PAX West that mouse and keyboard support for the Xbox is coming "soon". Although no games supporting these peripherals have been announced, Ybarra has guaranteed Microsoft will be offering to coach developers on how to add the feature into their games.<p><br></p><p><br></p><p>It's been long disputed that PC players have an advantage over platform gamers due to the mouse and keyboard being more accurate and suitable for genres like First Person Shooters. Inputting a mouse will allow Xbox One players to take aim and manoeuvre about as quickly as their PC counterparts. <i>Gears of War 4 </i>already allows cross-platform multiplayer so it seems like the next step for Microsoft would be to release more cross-play games that give players the opportunity to play against each other based on peripherals.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>However, before you get excited about the prospect of playing your favourite Xbox One games with a mouse and keyboard, the feature is up to the choice of the developer. This means it's not mandatory for all game to have mouse &amp; keyboard support and developers can opt for not integrating it into their games.</p>
