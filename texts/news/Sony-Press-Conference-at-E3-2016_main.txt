With Microsoft out of the way, it’s time to see what Sony has to show off.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%" lang="EN-US">11:00AM – God Of War</span></b></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%" lang="EN-US">Sony’s conference starts off slightly unusually this year, with a live orchestra playing some ominous music to hype everyone up. It’s a bit of a change from all the dubstep from recent years. This leads us into a live demo for God Of War, where we see Kratos being a crappy father figure to a young kid. And doing, you know, God Of War stuff. I’ve never played the franchise so I don’t have much to say about it to be honest. God Of War is coming to PS4, although there’s no release date or time frame yet.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%" lang="EN-US">11:15AM – Shawn Layden</span></b></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%" lang="EN-US">SIEA Shawn Layden addresses the audience and acknowledges the recent events in Orlando before moving on to the usual “what to expect tonight” speech. He keeps it short and sweet, jumping straight into the trailers.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%" lang="EN-US">11:20AM – Days Gone</span></b></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%" lang="EN-US">A new PS4 exclusive from Bend Studio is shown, titled “Days Gone”. Not a whole lot of gameplay shown, mostly cinematic, showing off some nice scenery. You seem to play as “a drifter, a bounty hunter, a mercenary”…or James Franco? No release date yet.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%" lang="EN-US">11:22AM – The Last Guardian</span></b></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%" lang="EN-US">Next up is The Last Guardian, being the first trailer since last year’s E3. It finally has a release date: October 25, 2016. It’s actually happening!</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%" lang="EN-US">11:25AM – Horizon Zero Dawn </span></b></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%" lang="EN-US">Next we’ve got a new gameplay trailer for Horizon Zero Dawn. As we already know it’s been delayed until next year, but it’s good to get a new look at the gameplay.We get to see some of the crafting system in action, as well as some new elements like taming creatures. The game still looks beautiful, my only gripe being with the NPC interaction. The dialogue could use a little work.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%" lang="EN-US">11:30 - Detroit: Become Human</span></b></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%" lang="EN-US">Here we have the second trailer for Quantic Dream’s new game, Detroit: Become Human.This one follows a new character named Connor, who appears to be some kind of android cop. So far it seems like a standard Quantic Dream game, very cinematic with lots of drama and awkward dialogue. We also get to see some gameplay elements, such as narrative branching and some detective work. I’m pretty excited for this game, being a Heavy Rain fan. Again, no release date.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%" lang="EN-US">11:34Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</span></b></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%" lang="EN-US">Changing things up a little, we’ve now got a trailer for a PS VR game, which turns out to be Resident Evil 7: Biohazard. I can see this being a fantastic game on PSVR, however for those (like me) who will be skipping out on PS VR it will also be available on PS4. The release date is currently slated for January 24, 2017 and the demo is available now.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%" lang="EN-US">11:40AM - PS VR News</span></b></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%" lang="EN-US">Shawn Layden returns to the stage and announces the release date for PS VR as October 13, 2016. This was initially announced specifically for the US, however the Playstation ANZ Twitter has also confirmed this date. Layden also announced the price as $399 USD, however most Australian retailers are still listing the PSVR as $549.95 AUD at the time of writing this. There are currently over 50 games in development for PS VR.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%" lang="EN-US">11:43AM - PS VR Show Reel</span></b></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%" lang="EN-US">Following the PS VR news we get a look at some trailers for some upcoming PS VR exclusives.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%" lang="EN-US"><b style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%">Farpoint: </b>Looks like an FPS set on another planet. Not a whole lot of information given,the gameplay looks to be combat based. A few cool looking creatures in there. I feel like giant spider-type creatures seem to be a recurring theme this E3.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%" lang="EN-US"><b style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%">Star Wars Battlefront X-Wing VR Mission:</b> Self-explanatory, you get to pilot an X-Wing. It’s unclear at this point whether or not it’s just a single mission,an expansion or something else. It is a PS VR exclusive though.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%" lang="EN-US"><b style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%">Batman Arkham VR:</b> There is zero gameplay shown in this trailer so I have no idea what the game will be like.

Imagine a Final Fantasy game composed entirely by Afrojack. It must be what heaven is like. Moving on, the VR aspect of FFXV is a little unclear as the first half of the trailer didn’t appear to be in VR. Apparently you can play as Prompto, although I’m not sure how this is integrated into the game.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%" lang="EN-US">11:50AM – Call Of Duty: Infinite Warfare</span></b></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%" lang="EN-US">With VR out of the way it’s time for more trailers. Next up is COD: Infinite Warfare. We are shown some gameplay, featuring combat in space. The zero gravity looks like it could be an interesting mechanic, but most people know by now whether they’re into the series or not. We are also given a look at Modern Warfare Remastered.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%" lang="EN-US">11:55 - Crash Bandicoot Remastered, Skylanders</span></b></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%" lang="EN-US">Crash Bandicoot 1 – 3 are receiving the remastered treatment, being built from the ground up. As this is coming off of the Ratchet and Clank remaster, I’m feeling bitter that it’s not the first three Spyro games. That said this is still exciting for those who grew up with the games. In addition to this announcement, Crash will also be a playable character in the upcoming Skylanders game, Skylanders Imaginators.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%" lang="EN-US">12:00PM – Lego Force Awakens</span></b></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%" lang="EN-US">Following the Crash news we get a Lego Force Awakens trailer. Looks pretty good, but we all know the drill with Lego games based on films by now. The demo is now available and the full game on June 28, 2016.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%" lang="EN-US">12:01PM – Hideo Kojima and Death Stranding. </span></b></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%" lang="EN-US">Andrew House takes the stage and introduces our lord and savior Hideo Kojima. After his dramatic entrance Kojima shows off a trailer for his new game, Death Stranding. Again I have no idea what it’s about, but I can tell you it has Norman Reedus in it and he appears to have given birth to a baby. Oh also he’s naked on some kind of beach.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%" lang="EN-US">12:07PM – Spiderman </span></b></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%" lang="EN-US">Finally we have the last trailer of the conference with Spiderman PS4. It’s looking to be a PS4 exclusive with no release date yet. It looks quite good from the trailer, but it’s been such a long time since we’ve had a good Spiderman game. It’s being developed by Insomniac so I have faith.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%" lang="EN-US">12:10 - Days Gone Demo, Conference Wraps Up</span></b></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%" lang="EN-US">Shawn Layden returns to the stage to conclude the conference and we’re left with a demo of Days Gone, which we saw the trailer for earlier. It’s looking to be a third person zombie game where you fight off hordes of zombies (or something similar). The sheer number of enemies on screen is impressive but the enemies themselves don’t seem to do much except run at you, so I can’t say I’m too excited yet. I’m probably in the minority on that though.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%" lang="EN-US">The conference ends with a quick show reel of games, some we’ve seen today and others we haven’t.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%" lang="EN-US">Overall Sony held a good conference, showing something for everyone to enjoy. It was always going to be hard to top last year’s conference, but many may feel that they managed to do so.</span></p>
