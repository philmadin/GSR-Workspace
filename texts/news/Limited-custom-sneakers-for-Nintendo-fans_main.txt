<p>From the same custom sneaker artists who brought us the <a href="http://freakersneaks.com/product/jordan-super-nintendo-iv/">Jordan "Super Nintendo" 4</a>, Sneaker Freaks have in store a limited edition design that will excite gamers and NBA fans alike. The <a href="http://freakersneaks.com/product/jordan-us-super-nintendo-nba-jam-edition-iv/">Jordan "US Super Nintendo" IV NBA Jam Edition</a> is a mash-up of the two of the top icons from the 90s: The Super Nintendo and Air Jordan 4s. Adding to the novelty of looking cute and reminiscent, each pair of sneakers is actually made using real Super Nintendo controller parts. The buttons located on the achilles are even clickable!&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The light grey and lilac purple colour scheme emulates the Super Nintendo console exterior and classic NBA tongue tags 'Final Edition' were added for a complete 90s effect. So if you're still on the lookout for Christmas gift ideas, a pair of these will unfortunately set you back $1250 USD but the site offers international shipping.</p>
