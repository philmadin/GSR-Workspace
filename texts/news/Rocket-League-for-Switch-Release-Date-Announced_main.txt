<p>(Puts on Farnsworth's voice) Good news everyone!!! Psyonix has announced today that<i> Rocket League</i> will be launching on the Nintendo Switch on the 14th of November.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Including all of the features, upgrades and content of the game as we know it, Switch players will also have access to exclusive Battle-Cars and customisation options. What are they you may ask?&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>There are&nbsp;the Mario and Luigi NSR cars, automatically chosen based on which team you're on. Orange will see you playing in Mario's car, Blue will be Luigi's. There's also a funky looking Samus' Gunship Battle-Car to blast around in with exclusive colour variations for each team. Each car has its own exclusive Rocket Booster to unlock, with Mario and Luigi Toppers available for all other non-licensed Battle-Car.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The Switch version will also ship with local wireless multiplayer support which is pretty rad, adding to the already extensive list of gameplay options. Don't forget that it's also cross-platform compatible with all other devices, except for the PlayStation 4 (for reasons we still don't quite understand).</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Look for <i>Rocket League</i> in the Nintendo eShop for $20 USD.</p>
