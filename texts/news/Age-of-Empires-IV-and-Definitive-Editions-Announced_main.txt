<p>In exciting news that no-one saw coming, Microsoft have announced that <i>Age of Empires 4</i> is in development exclusively for PC. The news came during their press conference at Gamescom, and will be the first proper entry in the iconic franchise in over 10 years. Very little was revealed with no release window given, but here is what we know so far.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Relic Entertainment now has the reins for this much-loved series, and they are no strangers to making solid real-time strategy games. Being responsible for multiple titles in franchises such as&nbsp;</span><i>Company of Heroes</i><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">,&nbsp;</span><i>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War</i><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><i>Homeworld</i>, they certainly have the expertise to do this series justice.<br></p><p><br></p><p>The announcement came with a concept trailer that you can watch below. Roman Legionnaires, Native Americans, Japanese Samurai and British Redcoats amongst others make appearances - what this implies, however, is unclear. While it does suggest a return to the eras that <i>Age of Empires</i>&nbsp;is known for, whether or not it is showcasing actual playable units/factions or simply honouring the series' history remains to be seen.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The now defunct Ensemble Studios gave us the original&nbsp;<i>Age of Empires</i>&nbsp;way back in 1997, with sequels being released in 1999 and 2005 alongside an extensive catalog of expansions and add-ons. In recognition of this history, Microsoft has announced that <i>Age of Empires: Definitive Edition</i>&nbsp;will be released on October 19 and will be a full 4K remaster of the game that started it all 20 years ago. To top it all off, they also revealed that we will be seeing Definitive Edition versions of both <i>Age of Empires 2</i>&nbsp;and <i>3</i>.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>If you simply cannot wait until October, it is possible to sign up for the closed beta of <i>Age of Empires: Definitive Edition </i><a href="https://www.ageofempires.com/age-insider-information/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
