<p>After months of leaks, rumours and teasing, we finally have confirmation that the Xbox One X exists - and damn does it look good. Previously known as Project Scorpio, Microsoft is calling it the most powerful console ever, and releases globally on November 7, 2017 for AU$649.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The Xbox One X is the most powerful and smallest console to date, with a claimed 40 percent more power than any console currently in existence. With the industry moving full tilt towards 4K, the One X does its part by offering true 4K gaming, and supports 4K UltraHD for both Blu-ray and streamed content. As the name implies however, this is not a standalone console - it is designed to coexist alongside the Xbox One and the Xbox One S, and supports all the existing games and accessories in the Xbox One family.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>A great example of this is with games - they will <i>not</i> be One X exclusive. Developers must makes games that will work on both the One X and the One/One S. The extra power means developers can now add better textures, smoother framerates and faster load times, but existing owners can still jump in with the new releases that were announced. Quite a number of existing games will also receive free updates to take full advantage of the extra power available.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>In terms of power, the One X will ship with 6 teraflops of graphical power and a custom GPU engine running at 1172MHz, which is considerably faster than both the Xbox One and PS4 Pro. We now get an Ultra HD Blu-ray drive, but unfortunately the same tiny 1TB of storage, which I'm sure many would argue is not enough even on the current consoles. But what does all this raw power get you?&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>In <i>Forza Motorsport 7</i>, the Xbox One X was capable of showing fantastic amounts of detail both inside and outside of the car. We are now seeing stitching on the steering wheel, and cars are just as crisp whether they are in front of you or right off in the distance. When the cars are up to full speed, parts of the exterior will even begin to rattle with the wind - seeing the mirror vibrate (reflections and all) is incredibly satisfying.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>They also showcased a current game running on the new hardware. An updated <i>Gears of War 4</i> allowed the One X to show off its HDR capabilities which, when paired with a capable display, shows sunlight so bright you'll want to shield your eyes. It also demonstrated the difference between old and new with much sharper textures everywhere you looked.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>To coincide with the release, Xbox announced a record 42 games, 22 of which will be Xbox One family exclusives. On top of this, they have also revealed that the backward compatible library of nearly 400 Xbox 360 games will be expanded to include original Xbox classics.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Stay tuned for a full wrap-up from Xbox's E3 announcement.</p>
