<p>The seventh <i>League of Legends</i> annual World Championship Finals were held in Beijing, China on Saturday. Possibly, the most shocking final in <i>League of Legends</i> history, team Samsung Galaxy was able to defeat the three-time champions of the game, SK Telecom T1, 3-0. It seemed early on that Samsung Galaxy was struggling to keep up with their opponents. They turned their game around by focusing on teamwork and team fights. In particular, Samsung ADC Park "Ruler" Jae-hyuk sealed the victory for his team by catching SKT's star payer Lee "Faker" Sang-hyeok off guard. It was then that the winner of the Summoner's Cup was clearly going to be South Korea's Samsung Galaxy.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The Beijing National Stadium was packed full of excited fans who were also treated to a concert featuring international artists and <i>League of Legends</i> community musicians in between cheering on their favourite teams.
