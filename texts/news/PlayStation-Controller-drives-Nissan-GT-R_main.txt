<p>In case you haven't heard, PlayStation 4 is getting its own <i>Gran Turismo</i> title this month. Developed by Polyphony Digital and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment, <i>Gran Turismo Sport</i> is a racing game that will include three game modes: 'Campaign', 'Sports Mode' and 'Arcade Mode'. To promote the upcoming release, Nissan modified a special Nissan GT-R (appropriately named the 'Nissan GTR/C') so that it can be driven by a PlayStation 4 controller.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Watch the video below to see the remote controlled car make laps around England's Silverstone Circuit, controlled by Nissan race car driver and former GT Academy winner, Jann Mardenborough. A standard PlayStation DualShock 4 controller was connected to a computer which manipulates the wheels, accelerator, brakes and transmission of the GT-R. In order to get a good view of the circuit, Mardenborough was flown up on a helicopter. From there he managed to clock in a time of one minute and 17.47 seconds, beating the Silverstone single-lap record by 13.151 seconds.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Unfortunately though, purchasing a copy of <i>Gran Turismo Sport </i>will not be able to give players a go at racing a real Nissan GTR/C. Instead, an immersive experience will be limited to a special 'VR Tour Mode' that is meant to support the PlayStation VR headset.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><i>Gran Turismo Sport</i> will be on sale October 17th in North America, October 18th in Australia and Europe, and October 19th in Japan.</p>
