<i>Final Fantasy XV: Episode Prompto</i> is coming out on 27th June and here is an early look at some of the gameplay. <i>Episode Prompto </i>is the second episode in a series of content that will continue to be released for <i>Final Fantasy XV. <br><br></i>The gameplay demo seems to be the opening tutorial for the play-style of Prompto, which is different to that of Noctis and Gladio. It looks to be a stealth/shooter hybrid, with Prompto using different guns to handle enemies. There also seems to be timed challenges, which may add a degree of difficulty as the episode progresses. Hopefully, there will be enemy scaling, as Prompto's style of play looks very easy and straightforward. <br><br>
