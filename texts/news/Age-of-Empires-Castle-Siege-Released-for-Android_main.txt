Choose from one of six civilizations (including the Britons, Teutons, and Kievan Rus), then upgrade your keep, fortify your walls and garrison defensive troops to protect against marauders as you train and prepare your army for raids. Command your troops in battle by controlling all of your units at any time, allowing for a deeper and more tactical gameplay experience than other titles in this genre. Build your castle through the ages, researching technology and recruiting a variety of powerful heroes such as Saladin, Richard the Lionheart and Joan of Arc. By outsmarting attackers and overwhelming defenders, you can earn achievements and climb to the top of the leaderboards.</span></p><p><font color="#505050"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><br></span></font></p><p><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Released back in 2014 for Windows devices and 2015 for iOS, the Android release has been well overdue. While sharing many similarities with the popular Clash of Clans, Castle Siege offers more granular control over your army, unit/building development costs and times are generally less and is on the whole more realistic. Plus, Age of Empires defined this style of gameplay and know what they're doing - definitely worth a look if you haven't already!</span></p>
