<p>The Ubisoft conference this year was one of the most surprise-filled and exciting conferences at E3. Here's the full list of major announcements and trailers shown!</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Xbox One is used in this context to refer to the Xbox One, the Xbox One S, and the Xbox One X. Playstation 4 is used to refer to the Playstation 4 and the Playstation 4 Pro. A note will be made if the broad term does not include one of these consoles.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Name:</b> <i>Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle</i></p><p><br></p><p><b>Shown:</b> A new trailer, exploration gameplay, and combat gameplay with walkthrough</p><p><br></p><p>Comments: This announcement comes completely out of the blue, and it was incredible to see Shigeru Miyamoto from Nintendo join Yves Guillemot on stage. As for the game itself, Shigeru asked the creative director not to create a platformer, but to make a new game that has never been done with Mario before. It looks like they delivered, and Mario + Rabbids looks like a creative strategic battle game featuring skill trees, moves such as team jump, and a cover system.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Release Date:</b> August 29</p><p><br></p><p><b>Platforms:</b> Nintendo Switch</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Name:</b> <i>Assassin's Creed Origins</i></p><p><br></p><p><b>Shown:</b> A new trailer</p><p><br></p><p><b>Comments:</b> The first look we had at Assassin's Creed: Origins was during the Microsoft conference, so a new trailer is quite welcome. We also got a chance to see some more gameplay in the post-show, and it looks like the best Assassin's Creed since Black Flag.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Release Date:</b> October 27</p><p><br></p><p><b>Platforms: </b>PC, Playstation 4, Xbox One</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Name:</b> <i>The Crew 2</i></p><p><br></p><p><b>Shown:</b> A new trailer and some gameplay footage of the types of vehicle that will be playable.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Comments:</b> The Crew 2 is using (presumably) an improved version of the same map - that is to say, the United States - but now they are expanding into "all motorsports". This means bikes, boats, and planes, as we saw in the Inception-inspired trailer.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Release Date:</b> Early 2018</p><p><br></p><p><b>Platforms:</b> PC, Playstation 4, Xbox One</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Name:</b> <i>South Park: The Fractured But Whole</i></p><p><br></p><p><b>Shown:</b> A new trailer</p><p><br></p><p><b>Comments:</b> Nothing new was revealed or shown.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Release Date:</b> October 17</p><p><br></p><p><b>Platforms:</b> PC, Playstation 4, Xbox One</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Name:</b> <i>Transference</i></p><p><br></p><p><b>Shown:</b> A trailer featuring Elijah Wood talking about the project and some horror imagery, but no gameplay or hints as to the subject of the game</p><p><br></p><p><b>Comments:</b> Yeah, we know absolutely nothing about this game other than the fact that it's a VR psychological horror game created by Elijah Wood. Wood mentioned the concept of uploading from the brain, but that's all we know.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Release Date:</b> Spring 2018 (US)</p><p><br></p><p><b>Platforms:</b> PC, Playstation 4, Xbox One</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Name:</b> <i>Skull &amp; Bones</i></p><p><br></p><p><b>Shown:</b> A new trailer, 5v5 PvP gameplay, and a short teaser featuring a giant squid.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Comments:</b> Skull &amp; Bones is a new single and multiplayer pirate game set on the Indian Ocean. To simply call this a new IP would completely disregard most of the information we have about it. It's a new game that isn't in any existing franchises, but the gameplay certainly seems to be extremely similar to it's origin, Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. This game features cannons, mortars, battering rams, sea shanties, ship boarding, and loot collection, just like Black Flag. But it introduces multiplayer - where everyone gets their own ship, by the looks - and according to a tiny teaser, giant squids.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Release Date:</b> Fall 2018 (US)</p><p><br></p><p><b>Platforms:</b> PC, Playstation 4, Xbox One</p><p><br></p><p><b>Beta:</b> Sign up at skullandbonesgame.com</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Name:</b> <i>Just Dance 2018</i></p><p><br></p><p><b>Shown:</b> A dance featuring robotic pop-and-locking and... K-pop? Not entirely sure what happened there</p><p><br></p><p><b>Comments:</b> N/A</p><p><br></p><p><b>Release Date:</b> October 2017</p><p><br></p><p><b>Platforms:</b> PC, Playstation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Name:</b> <i>South Park: Phone Destroyer</i></p><p><br></p><p><b>Shown:</b> A trailer</p><p><br></p><p><b>Comments:</b> A free-to-play mobile card game with real time combat, according to official sources.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Release Date:</b> 2017</p><p><br></p><p><b>Platforms:</b> Android, iOS</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Name:</b> <i>Starlink: Battle for Atlas</i></p><p><br></p><p><b>Shown:</b> A new trailer and some gameplay with description</p><p><br></p><p><b>Comments:</b> Build a custom starship, link extra armour and weapons (using Amiibo on Switch), in an open world space game featuring bandits and asteroid fields. We don't know too much about this game, but provided their ship combat is better than No Man's Sky, it should be good.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Release Date:</b> Fall 2018</p><p><br></p><p><b>Platforms:</b> Playstation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Name:</b> <i>Steep: Road To The Olympics</i></p><p><br></p><p><b>Shown:</b> A new trailer</p><p><br></p><p><b>Comments:</b> After the Ubisoft pre-show, I was expecting it to be the Steep: Extreme Pack but instead, they announced their first expansion, based on the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympics. It seems to have as many game modes or sports as the actual Winter Olympics, which is good if anyone out there is still playing Steep.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Release Date:</b> December 5</p><p><br></p><p><b>Platforms:</b> PC, Playstation 4, Xbox One</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Name:</b> <i>Far Cry 5</i></p><p><br></p><p><b>Shown: </b>A new trailer and some gameplay</p><p><br></p><p><b>Comments:</b> About a week after the initial announcement, it's nice to see some gameplay this early on. It sounds like the campaign will be playable in co-op, much like Far Cry 4, and you'll be able to command a small team of AI.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Release Date:</b> February 27, 2018</p><p><br></p><p><b>Platforms: </b>PC, Playstation 4, Xbox One</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Name:</b> <i>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</i></p><p><br></p><p><b>Shown:</b> A new trailer</p><p><br></p><p><b>Comments:</b> Another game no-one expected, but one that many have been waiting and hoping for. Aside from exploring a sprawling open world with cities, mountains, and countryside, the player will be able to fly into space seamlessly as well. The story takes place before the first one, and is set in the 24th century where hybrid slaves and interstellar colonisation are the norm.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Release Date:</b> Unknown</p><p><br></p><p><b>Platforms:</b> Unknown, but you can bet that this will come to at least one of the powerful new consoles announced last year.</p><p></p>
