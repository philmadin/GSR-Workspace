<p>Escape from Tarkov developer Battlestate Games will introduce a new game mechanic/faction for the highly anticipated MMO/FPS. Previously seen only in videos, Battlestate will be showcasing gameplay based on a special faction within the game called the Scavs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Scavs are marauders who remained in the city of Tarkov after the government lockdown in order to seize property left behind by citizens, while also fighting any forces attempting to restore law and order in the city. The Scavs will be a playable faction, and will cause plenty of trouble for those playing as Operatives of the two Escape from Tarkov PMC factions (USEC and BEAR).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>"Playing as a Scav is like playing the game without rules, one where the players can experience quite different gameplay with a focus on reckless abandon," commented Nikita Buyanov, COO of Battlestate Games and Project Lead, Escape From Tarkov. "The Scav player is spawned together with AI Scavs - for example, in a locked spot on the map, in the middle of the time allocated for the raid. Scav tactics change up the overall style of raid gameplay, and in most cases, complicating the lives of BEAR and USEC players, while also fighting among themselves."</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Soon, players will be able to enter Escape from Tarkov raids as the renegade Scavs - and upon doing so, they will be assigned a random player name, equipment and weapons. The spawn times for Scavs will also be randomly set. The Scavs can group up in packs of up to four players. If a Scav player survives the raid, they will be able to move collected loot into the stash of their main character. The opportunity to play as Scav will be limited in frequency, so it's best to jump into the Scav role while you can!<br></p>
