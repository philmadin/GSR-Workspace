<p>October's here and with it comes a whole new batch of PlayStation Plus games for you to sink your teeth into! In fact, this might be the best month of PlayStation games we've had in a while. With six new additions joining a couple of ongoing offers from PS Plus.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Let's start with the best in my opinion: <i>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</i> - which was released in 2015 to stellar reviews. You can read ours <a href="http://gamesharkreviews.com/review.php?t=Metal_Gear_Solid_V%3A_The_Phantom_Pain_Review&amp;g=Metal_Gear_Solid_V%3A_The_Phantom_Pain">here</a>. If you haven't had the chance to check this stealth action game out yet, now is the perfect opportunity!&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Since its October (spooky!) there's a fitting inclusion of <i>Amnesia: Collection</i>, which comes packed with <i>The Dark Descent</i>, <i>A Machine For Pigs</i>, and <i>Justine</i>. We recommended playing with the lights off, just so you can be extra scared this Halloween.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Next, we have <i>That's You!</i> a recent release that's perfect to play with your friends. While we haven't had a chance to play this one yet, we've been hearing good things! Note, you'll need a compatible mobile device to play.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>You can also still get your hands on <i>RIGS Mechanized Combat League</i> for some VR fun until November 7th.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Award-winning indie hit<i> Hue</i> is also available on PS4 and PS Vita. And you can pick up Sky Force: Anniversary edition on PS4, PS3, and PS Vita for some classic side-scrolling fun.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>And finally, stepping away from the PS4 titles we have: <i>Monster Jam Battlegrounds</i> and <i>Hustle Kings</i> on PS3.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">se October PS Plus freebies are available now and will stick around until the end of October. Excluding That's you! which is making an exit from PS Plus on October 24th, so get in quick!&nbsp;</span></p><style> <!-- /* Font Definitions */ @font-face {font-family:"Cambria Math"; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:1; mso-generic-font-family:roman; mso-font-format:other; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:0 0 0 0 0 0;} @font-face {font-family:Calibri; panose-1:2 15 5 2 2 2 4 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1073786111 1 0 415 0;} /* Style Definitions */ p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso-style-unhide:no; mso-style-qformat:yes; mso-style-parent:""; margin:0cm; margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:Calibri; mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi; mso-fareast-language:EN-US;} .MsoChpDefault {mso-style-type:export-only; mso-default-props:yes; font-family:Calibri; mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi; mso-fareast-language:EN-US;} @page WordSection1 {size:612.0pt 792.0pt; margin:72.0pt 72.0pt 72.0pt 72.0pt; mso-header-margin:36.0pt; mso-footer-margin:36.0pt; mso-paper-source:0;} div.WordSection1 {page:WordSection1;} --> </style>
