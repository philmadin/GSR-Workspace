Netflix's hit drama, <i>Stranger Things</i>, will be returning for a second season on October 27th. To celebrate, Netflix has teamed up with developer BonusXP to bring an official game to Android and iOS gamers. <i>Stranger Things: The Game</i> is a free-to-play action adventure game based in Hawkins, Indiana and features Hopper and the kids from the series. The quirkiness of the game comes from the retro-style pixel graphics which try to emulate the era in which the show is set. The graphics however, are more partial to the 1990 Nintendo Gameboy graphics though.<p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Each of the show's main characters are playable and they all have their own set of unique abilities. You can solve puzzles as Lucas, who can nail anything with his 'wrist rocket', or Nancy who has a whole set of bats. You can take your time exploring some of the locations seen in the show such as Mirkwood Forest and Hawkins Lab. There are bonus areas within Hawkins to discover as well.</p><p><br><br></p><p>Watch th<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">e trailer for </span><i>Stranger Things: The Game </i><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">below.</span></p>
