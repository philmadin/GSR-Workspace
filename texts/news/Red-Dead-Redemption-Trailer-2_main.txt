<p><p>Information has been scarce for <i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i>. The first trailer came out almost a year ago, and the last official release of anything was back in May for some screenshots. Rockstar has certainly been keeping tight-lipped on this game, but thankfully we now have a second trailer to glean over and analyse again and again and again.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The new trailer gives us some insight into the story of outlaw Arthur Morgan. Showcasing locations, characters, animals, arrows, and a bucket load more, we also learn that this is a definite prequel to the critically acclaimed <i>Red Dead Redemption</i>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>A younger Dutch is back as the leader of the Van der Linde gang from the first game. If you recall, he was the arch-enemy of the previous protagonist John Marston, so we may also see more of John too. The story follows the Van der Linde gang as they rob, steal and fight their way across America in order to survive. One of the most exciting tid-bits of speculation is the potential for <i>GTA V-</i>esque&nbsp;heists as we galavant across the US of A, as the trailer does reveal some pretty damn incredible setpieces.</p><p><br></p><p><i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i>&nbsp;will be coming to PS4 and Xbox One in Autumn 2018.</p></p>
