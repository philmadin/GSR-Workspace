<p>CI Games today announced its future strategy for the company including some hints at upcoming plans moving forward.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The company confirmed plans to create a new tactical shooter that will be announced at a later time. Additionally, CI Games also reiterated its commitment to a sequel for the acclaimed <i>Lords of the Fallen</i>, and will also continue supporting <i>Sniper Ghost Warrior 3</i> with future updates through 2017.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>"We've learned a lot as a team over the course of development for Sniper Ghost Warrior 3, much of which I believe has shaped the talented individuals within CI Games and the entire studio for the better," said Chief Executive Officer Marek Tyminski. "When we began development of SGW3, we decided on such a relatively large scale of the game with its open world that now we realise it was just too ambitious versus what we could have been able to deliver in any reasonable amount of time. We simply made the wrong math considering the size of our team and the originally given timeframe.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>By positioning the game in a AAA category, it took us away from what we could have done great. Instead, we spent too much effort trying to catch up with other AAA titles in terms of their production values and features. That was a big mistake."</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Continued Tyminski, "All of that was a huge lesson for us and we're now moving forward without any tag attached to our next project. We're planning to make a great tactical shooter where we can focus on exciting gameplay, some key mechanics, and missions that have depth without all of the trappings of a large open-world setting. We want to make this game even more tactical than SGW3, and I believe the last three years have created a wonderful foundation that we can build upon for our next game."</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>For more information about CI Games, head to <a href="http://cigames.com/">cigames.com</a>.</p>
