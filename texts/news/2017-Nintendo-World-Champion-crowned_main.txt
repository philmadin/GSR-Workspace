<p>Nintendo held the <a href="https://nwc.nintendo.com">2017 Nintendo World Championships</a> a few days ago in New York City. After four hours and 24 competitors, Thomas Gonda from Oakland, California was crowned the winner of the World Championships. The 21-year-old, who also goes by the handle 'Ito', was presented with a golden Mario trophy in recognition of his achievement.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Hosted by gaming personality Andrea Rene as well as various members from Nintendo's Treehouse offering additional commentary, competitors had to beat each other in popular Nintendo titles from the last 30 years. Sixteen of the competitors won their spot in the tournament from local qualifying rounds held at various Best Buy retail locations. Recent systems like the Nintendo Switch, Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo Wii may have been more accessible to participants, but we really admire Gonda for mastering games on the Nintendo Entertainment System, Nintendo 64 and Gameboy Colour. These consoles are obviously very difficult to find still in working order.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/the-nintendo-world-championships-2017-winner-has-been-crowned">Events</a> that players had to compete in included surfing in <i>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</i>, sandbag beating in <i>Super Smash Bros.,</i> as well as racing in both <i>Metroid: Samus Returns</i> and <i>Donkey Kong Country Returns</i>.
