Last year we had the Rio Olympic Games (man, how time has flown), and to commemorate the occasion, Blizzard launched their first seasonal event in <i>Overwatch</i>&nbsp;- the Summer Games. They introduced us to unique game modes with custom maps, new skins and unlockables, and paved the way for the events to come.<p><br></p><p><br></p><p>While we don't have any Olympics this year, we do thankfully have the return of the Summer Games in <i>Overwatch</i>. Starting on the 8th of August, players will be able to dive back into a refreshed 'Lucioball' and unlock a bunch of stuff both new and old.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>For those that don't know, 'Lucioball' was a fantastic arcade mode that had you playing 3v3 soccer as, you guessed it, Lucio. The arena had wall-riding opportunities and jump-pads, and the quick 4 minute games were frantic as you tried to score against the opposing team. Your Sonic Amplifier (main weapon) takes care of ball duties, and your cross-fade is locked to the speed boost.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>It's had a couple of tweaks for this season though, as there were some handy hacks that players were exploiting.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Gone is the ability to 'boop' opponents, and your ultimate now increases movement speed and 'boop' refresh times as opposed to pulling the ball to you.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">To spice things up even more, we are getting a second stadium to play in Sydney, and there is also going to be a second competitive mode just for Lucioball - allowing players to place and rank and earn exclusive sprays.</span></p><p></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Players will have the opportunity to unlock all of the original content from the original Summer Games - those who missed out on the skins will finally have a chance to get them again! There will also be new skins available (our favourite Australian Junkrat is finally getting another Legendary skin) on top of extra sprays and emotes.</p><p></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>It's worth<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"> noting that the 2016&nbsp;cosmetics will be available at a reduced cost compared to the 2017 stream of unlocks. Rare tier is 75/250, Epic is 250/750 and Legendary will be going for 1,000/3,000. It is definitely nice to have access to those old skins as I for one missed out on a couple that I'd love to get my hands on, and I cannot wait to see what the new ones will be like.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Summer Games runs from the 8th -29th of August on PC, Xbox One and PS4.&nbsp;</p>
