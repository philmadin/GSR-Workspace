The final piece of the puzzle that was the Bethesda E3 press conference came in the form of a large Dishonored 2 reveal.<br><br>The game was announced at Bethesda's E3 conference last year but since there has been no new information, until now of course.<br><br>A number of videos were shown showcasing the new technology behind the game, a new in house game engine which Arkane Studios lovingly refers to as the Void Engine. The Void Engine seems to focus heavily on lighting and really accentuating the unique art style that the series is known for so well. The game also seems to allow the player to play as either Emily Kaldwin (the new protagonist) or Corvo Attano (the protagonist from the first game and father of Emily).<br><br>An extended game play trailer was also shown at the conference similar in structure to the first game play demo that accompanied Dishonored 1 at its first E3 reveal. The demo was able to showcase some of the new powers that the player will have at their disposal such as Domino (being able to chain effects across multiple enemies by only harming one) and Shadow Walk (a gruesome way to stealthily eliminate your enemies or pass by undetected). <br><br>Dishonored 2 appears to be shaping up very nicely and I'm looking forward to hearing and seeing more about it in the coming months up until its release on November 11th for PS4, Xbox One and PC.<br>
