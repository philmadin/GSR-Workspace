Following the release of the <i>Star Wars: Battlefront 2 Elite Trooper Deluxe Edition</i> on Tuesday the 14th of November, many gamers were left extremely angry at publisher EA and developer DICE.<br><br>After finding that many of their favourite characters from the movies were locked and required huge amounts of in-game currency which one user estimated would take upwards of 40 hours to unlock, or users (in what feels like usual EA fashion) could use a micro-transaction to purchase in-game currency to unlock the character they want.<br><br>DICE General Manager Oskar Gabrielson today released a statement addressing the current controversy saying:<br><br>"Thank you to everyone in our community for being the passionate fans that you are.<p>Our goal has always been to create the best possible game for all of you - devoted Star Wars fans and game players alike. We've also had an ongoing commitment to constantly listen, tune and evolve the experience as it grows. You've seen this with both the major adjustments and polish we have made over the past several weeks.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>But as we approach the worldwide launch, it's clear that many of you feel there are still challenges in the design. We've heard the concerns about potentially giving players unfair advantages. And we've heard that this is overshadowing an otherwise great game. This was never our intention. Sorry we didn't get this right.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>We hear you loud and clear, so we're turning off all in-game purchases. We will now spend more time listening, adjusting, balancing and tuning. This means that the option to purchase crystals in the game is now offline, and all progression will be earned through gameplay. The ability to purchase crystals in-game will become available at a later date, only after we've made changes to the game. We'll share more details as we work through this.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>We have created a game that is built on your input, and it will continue to evolve and grow. <i>Star Wars </i> Battlefront II is three times the size of the previous game, bringing to life a brand new <i>Star Wars </i> story, space battles, epic new multiplayer experiences across all three <i>Star Wars </i> eras, with more free content to come. We want you to enjoy it, so please keep your thoughts coming. And we will keep you updated on our progress".</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>This is<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">&nbsp;a big step for gamers in battling back against AAA developers and publishers trying to implement Pay to Win models in their favourite multiplayer games. Hopefully, this is the last controversy that occurs for the apparent controversy magnet that is </span><i>Star Wars: Battlefront 2</i><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">, and gamers can finally get back to enjoying the game.</span></p>
