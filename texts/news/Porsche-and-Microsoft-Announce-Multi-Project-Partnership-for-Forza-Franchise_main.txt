<p>At the New York International Auto Show, Porsche and Microsoft's Turn 10 Studios announced a six-year partnership to collaborate on a suite of co-branded initiatives for Porsche and the <i>Forza </i>franchise.</p><p></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p></p><p>Porsche previously had an exclusive license partnership with EA to use their vehicles in the <i>Need for Speed </i>and <i>Real Racing </i>series. The 16-year long contract began with 'Need for Speed: Porsche Unleashed' and meant that no other developer was able to use Porsche cars in their games, except for a small few who sub-licensed from EA. Other developers got around it by including cars from tuning house Ruf - which are known primarily for their tuning of Porsches.&nbsp;<br></p><p><br></p><p>The partnership kicks off today with open registration for Porsche's esports sponsorship debut in <i>Forza Racing Championship Season 3: The Porsche Cup</i> - the most inclusive racing esports program and home to the largest online racing community in gaming.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Also available today, the <i style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Forza Horizon 3 Porsche Car Pack </i>adds seven acclaimed Porsche vehicles to the open world of Australia's Horizon Festival.</span></p><p></p><p><p><br></p><p><br></p></p><p></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">EA has stated that "</span>We continue to have an excellent, long-standing relationship with Porsche. We mutually agreed earlier this year to continue our relationship under a non-exclusive licensing agreement, and we will continue to feature Porsche cars in future EA racing games." Given the ordinary reception the last few <i>Need for Speed</i>&nbsp;games have received it is a great move by Porsche given the past and present caliber of the industry-leading Forza franchise. More than anything it will be great to finally drive a properly simulated Porsche.</p><p><br></p><p></p><p></p><p><br></p><p></p>
