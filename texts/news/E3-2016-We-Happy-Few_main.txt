<p><i>We Happy Few</i> is the creepiest game I've ever seen. It's not a horror game, at least in the normal sense. In an alternative 1960s England, everyone takes a happy pill aptly called Joy. It makes them forget bad things, think nothing but positive thoughts, and desensitizes them to everything from violence to murder. This first person survival stealth adventure features crafting, permadeath, and a sandbox mode.</p><p>The player can choose to make their way through the procedurally generated city by conforming - pretending to be on Joy, sneaking through, or fighting through with fists or crafted weapons. If need be, they can also take the pill to walk through the city without arousing any suspicion whatsoever.</p><p><b><i>We Happy Few</i> will be available on Xbox One, PC, Linux and Mac on July 27.</b></p>
