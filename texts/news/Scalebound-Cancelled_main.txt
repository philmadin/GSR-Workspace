<br>Some sad news for Xbox fans, as Platinum Games' highly anticipated <i>Scalebound</i> has been canned.<br><br>In a statement by Microsoft on <a href="http://m.windowscentral.com/xbox-exclusive-scalebound-has-been-canceled">Windows Central</a>, they said:<br><br><blockquote><p align="center">"After careful deliberation, Microsoft Studios has come to the decision to end production for “Scalebound.” We’re working hard to deliver an amazing lineup of games to our fans this year, including “Halo Wars 2,” “Crackdown 3,” “State of Decay 2,” “Sea of Thieves” and other great experiences.

Platinum Games also touts its remaining game projects, <i>NieR: Automata</i>, <i>GRANBLUE FANTASY Project Re:Link</i>, and <i>Lost Order</i> as their upcoming titles to look forward to from the company."</p><p align="center"><br></p><p align="center"><br></p></blockquote>Shortly after the revelation, Microsoft began taking down <i>Scalebound</i>-related media, including videos. Rumours have started to circulate regarding creative issues between publisher and developer, with project lead Hideki Kamiya reportedly taking time off for mental stress. However, he has <a href="https://twitter.com/PG_kamiya?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">refuted</a> the claim, and addressed the cancellation as such: "I'll work extra hard to never have to let you down like this again, so I hope you will keep watching over us in the future too."<br><br><br>This is an undoubted blow to the Xbox brand, as it has long suffered from a dearth of Japanese-exclusive software. Thankfully, Microsoft still has promising 2017 title in its first party repertoire, with <i>Halo Wars 2</i>, <i>Sea</i> <i>of Thieves</i>, <i>Forza</i> <i>7</i>, <i>Crackdown</i> <i>3</i> and the indie-developed <i>Cuphead</i>.<br><br>
