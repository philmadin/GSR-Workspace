It takes inspiration from older <i>Final Fantasy</i> games, while allowing the player to customise the AI to adapt to any situation. <i>The Zodiac Age</i> will include 12 unique roles that can be assigned to each character. Some of the roles include Red Mage, Samurai, Knight and Monk. These roles will affect the stats of the character and how they perform in battle.<br><br><b><span style="color:rgb(255,0,0);">So How Does It Work?</span></b><br>Each character can be assigned a "gambit" which makes them perform a spell or attack when certain conditions are met. For example, if an ally falls below 40% health, you can then set a gambit to make another character heal them when that condition is met. The system is both a way to micromanage your group and maximise their potential as well.<br><br>The Gambit System isn't overly complicated but can be overwhelming to begin with. You can have as many or as few as you need to complete the game.<br><br><i>Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age</i> is set to release July 11th this year on PlayStation 4. <br>
