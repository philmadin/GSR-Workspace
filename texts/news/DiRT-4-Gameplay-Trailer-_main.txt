<p>Codemasters &amp; Koch Media have released a new <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><i style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">DiRT 4</i> gameplay trailer showcasing the breadth of racing that fans will be able to experience on PS4, Xbox One and Windows PC from 9th June 2017.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>With over 50 iconic off road vehicles from the history of the sport to modern day, <i>DiRT 4</i> challenges you to be fearless as you take on rally, rallycross and landrush. The all new DiRT Academy helps you learn the skills you need in order to reach the top of the sport and also doubles as your own off-road playground.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Racing between Australia, Spain, Michigan, Sweden and Wales all with their own weather, <i>DiRT 4</i> offers both Gamer and Simulation modes. With a fully realised damage model and a garage full of tuning and tweaks, you have the opportunity to make the game as arcadey or as full-on as you like. The game also features a 'Your Stage' system allowing you to produce a near infinite number of unique rally stages across these locations.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Partnering with Globe (Universals Music UK's in-house sync team), expect fantastic music with&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">over 40 licensed tracks appear throughout the game, matching <i style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">DiRT's</i> unique style and tone. Including exclusive tracks from artists such as The Amazons, Sigma, Freak and Pretty Vicious there will also be bangers from the likes of The Chemical Brothers, Disclosure, Queens Of The Stone Age and Bastille.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Following on from the critically acclaimed <i>DiRT Rally</i>, <i>DiRT 4</i> has some big shoes to fill - but with their pedigree of racing games, Codemasters should most definitely deliver. Expect a great mix of fun arcadey ridiculousness alongside incredibly realistic and stressful stints through a tight forest. I for one cannot wait.</p>
