<p>This week, at Gamescon in Cologne, Germany, Nintendo announced some updates to some of its most popular new IPs, upcoming games, and consoles. This includes updates to <i>Splatoon 2</i> and <i>ARMS</i>, as well as <i>Fire Emblem Warriors</i>, <i>Pokken Tournament DX</i>, among others.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>First up, there was an announcement from the Squid Research Lab to do with new content for <i>Splatoon 2</i>. A new map will be added called, 'Manta Maria'. It's a large boat and the focal point of this stage is the three masts you can do battle around. There will be a new special weapon, Bubble Blower. It will be available in a set with the Forge Splattershot Pro on the 2nd of September. Finally, Lost Outpost is already available as a new Salmon Run stage.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Next up is <i>ARMS</i>, where a new fighter has been announced. Lola Pop, a street performing pugilist, is a well-travelled clown with a colourful personality. She's able to inflate her body like a balloon, giving her good defensive qualities. She'll be available to use as part of the next free update. And in case you haven't tried the game out yet, you'll be able to do so in the <i>ARMS Global Testpunch</i> this weekend.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Another demo that's available on the eShop is the <i>Pokken Tournament DX</i>.
