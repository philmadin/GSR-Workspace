E3 2016 is finally here and to kick off, EA is bringing us their press event live from LA. But not everyone has time to watch these conferences, so I'll be writing details about the event as it unfolds for you to read in your own time.&nbsp;<p><br><p><b>6:10 AM - CEO's Address&nbsp;</b></p><p>Being an EA event, we need to be reminded that EA supposedly loves gamers and games by flashing buzzwords and then having the CEO come out to talk about the company's values. Also, it seems they are going to be livestreaming certain things from their synchronous event in London. After the event, they intend to host a 64 player livestreamed match of Battlefield 1. More buzzwords from CEO, Andrew Johnson.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><b>6:15 AM - Titanfall 2</b></p><p><b>Announcement: Titanfall 2 will be coming to PS4. </b>A multiplayer trailer of Titanfall 2 was shown, made up entirely from gameplay footage. A good start to the conference, with a lot of very exciting action.&nbsp;</p><p>More announcements: 6 new Titans. Go to titanfall.com to join their multiplayer test. Single player announced. Title is on both current gen consoles and PC.</p><p>A single player trailer was shown - &nbsp;the same one that was leaked hours earlier. (They acknowledged this in the conference.) Titan gameplay seems to be improved upon, but as someone who never got to play the original, I cannot confirm this.</p><p><br></p><p><b>6:20 AM - Madden 2017</b></p><p>A trailer was shown. Honestly, it looks like a football game, and I don't have much more to say about that. Franchise mode. New commentary team. New online modes and contests to reach out to E-sports fans. As a non-fan of this as well, I must say, that sounds pretty exciting.&nbsp;</p><p>A video was shown featuring the top 8 Madden players (in the world?). Nothing new or remotely exciting came of this, besides the announcement of a showdown between these 8 being livestreamed.</p><p>Peter in London announces a championship series with a one million dollar prize.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><b>6:25 AM - Mass Effect: Andromeda&nbsp;</b></p><p>The game will be powered by Frostbite. A trailer plays showing some behind the scenes footage and dialogue, as well as a couple of new shots from the game. It looks visually amazing, but so did Watch Dogs at E3 initially.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><b>6:30 AM - Andrew Johnson Returns With More Buzzwords</b></p><p>Content updates to Star Wars Battlefront, EA Access, Origin.</p><p><br></p><p><b>6:35 AM - FIFA 17</b></p><p>Video shows the evolution of FIFA games, ending in soccer player Alex Hunter coming on stage in London to talk about how similar the game is to real football. Trailer plays and reveals that the game uses Frostbite. Shows a storyline of sorts, leading to the announcement of a story mode: The Journey. Also, premier league managers are in the game. One of them, José, appears on stage in a slightly cringey comedic moment. Peter tries to sell the idea of in-app purchases by trying to coax support out of José.&nbsp;</p><p>Video plays to sell the gameplay changes, which include more control over set pieces and drastic AI improvements. Crowd seems underwhelmed.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><b>6:45 AM - EA Originals</b></p><p>Unknown man talks about how Unravel was a surprise success, and how EA will partner with indie developers and provide them with 100% of the profit.</p><p><b>New IP: Fe. </b>A game without words that is about nature and animals. Every creature including plants has a unique song, which the player, an animal, can join to learn the secret of the forest. Sounds like an exploration and stealth game. No tutorial whatsoever, which is an interesting idea. Trailer plays, showing a beautiful polygon alien world with a cool colour palette. All footage seems to be gameplay, albeit with altered camera work.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><b>6:50 - Star Wars</b></p><p>Many Star Wars games? Galaxy of Heroes, Battlefront, and Old Republic will continue to release new content. Next year, new Battlefront release from DICE. Other companies are working on story based games to release next year and beyond. Video plays showing interviews with developers of different Star Wars games. Very early in-game footage and cutscenes lasting a few seconds each are shown throughout.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><b>6:55 - Battlefield 1</b></p><p>And the third thing that people were waiting for is here. A new yet short trailer was shown. Live gameplay footage is promised immediately after the conference. Zac Efron and Jamie Foxx are nearby to play, and a brief and awkward interview with them is shown to hype people for the gameplay.&nbsp;</p><p>Dynamic weather. New weapons and vehicles, including behemoth vehicles such as airships, battleships, and trains. Open beta this summer. The trailer from earlier is shown again, as a full version featuring snippets of gameplay. And what a beautiful game it seems to be. I'm looking forward to riding some bikes with guns, and horses.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><b>7:05 - Conclusion and Round-Up</b></p><p>Andrew has to get a couple more words in, briefly noting to the audience that he's the only thing stands between the audience and some Battlefield gameplay, so he keeps it very brief. Congratulations to EA on a conference with minimal cringe (I'm just going to ignore that interview with Zac and Jamie).</p></p>
