<i>Blizzard</i> has updated <i>World of Warcraft</i> with the latest patch 7.0. This patch is leading the game into the beginning stages of <i>Legion</i>, introducing new elements and streamlining old ones as well. <br><br>One of the major changes is focused on how certain classes play. Specifically, Hunters, Rogues and Warlocks have had a major rework on how each of their specialisations function in order to improve overall gameplay.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">The other remaining classes have been adjusted, just not as significantly. Each class can now freely switch between specialisations without picking a primary and secondary spec. This will make it easier on players, as they will no longer be tied to two specific roles.</span><p><br>The next change is to how the Transmogrification system works. Items collected will become account-wide and bound to your character. They will then be displayed in the Appearances tab, allowing more room in your inventory. All items in your current inventory will be learned automatically when logging in for the first time after the patch is installed.<br><br>Character stats have been altered when participating in a PvP instance like a Battleground or Arena. Your character will be given a pre-determined set of stats, regardless of gear equipped. This is meant to shift the focus off gear and instead on player skill.<br><br>After this patch, you will no longer be able to begin the quest for the Legendary Ring. If it is already in your Quest Log, then you will have until Legion to complete it.<br><br><i>World of Warcraft: Legion</i> releases on August 30, 2016. The level cap will be increased to 110 and will add new areas, more raids and see the return of Illidan.<br><br><i>Blizzard&nbsp;</i>has a complete rundown of the new patch <a href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/20151961/legion-pre-expansion-patch-notes-7-18-2016">here</a><br><br>Simple patch summary: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kEN18ApF8<br><br><br><br></p>
