<p>With rumours of a new console, high expectations for games both new and old, and millions watching all around the world, Microsoft's press conference was easily one of the most anticipated ones at E3 this year. For simplicity, here is a summary of everything that happened at the Microsoft E3 Briefing in 2016.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Xbox One S</b></p><p>The briefing began with a preview of the updated version of the Xbox One, the Xbox One S. Selling points mentioned: 40% smaller, having a 2TB hard drive, an IR blaster, an integrated power supply, HDR gaming, 4K video and Blu-Ray, and a new wireless controller. The controller features a textured grip, Xbox Wireless, Bluetooth, and an increased range. Additionally, all games and accessories for Xbox One will be usable on Xbox One S. <b>The Xbox One S will be available in early August.</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Gears Of War 4</b></p><p><i>Gears Of War 4&nbsp;</i>marks the first game announced that will run on new program Xbox Play Anywhere, which will allow all digitally-purchased games to be played on Windows 10 PCs and Xbox Ones.&nbsp;<i>Gears Of War 4</i>&nbsp;will also support cross-platform play for its multiplayer and co-op modes.</p><p>The campaign mode was shown off with some apparently live gameplay from the new game. Nothing too fancy was shown, but the mission they played demonstrated some of the shiny new HDR imagery - although the colour palette of&nbsp;<i>Gears&nbsp;</i>doesn't exactly lend itself to a good demonstration for this. The footage also briefly outlined the campaign mode's story.&nbsp;<b><i>Gears Of War 4</i>&nbsp;arrives on both Xbox One and Windows 10 on October 11.</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Killer Instinct</b></p><p>For fans of both&nbsp;<i>Killer Instinct</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Gears Of War</i>, a character from the latter is being added to the former: General RAAM. A brief character trailer was shown, and it was announced that players can play free for this week.&nbsp;<i>Killer Instinct Season 3</i>&nbsp;is also on Xbox Play Anywhere, as I'm going to assume all games announced from here on will be. (I will specify if it is not.)&nbsp;<b>General RAAM is playable now in&nbsp;<i>Killer Instinct</i>, which is available on Xbox One and Windows 10.</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Forza Horizon 3</b></p><p>While I have a great deal of respect for the&nbsp;<i>Forza&nbsp;</i>franchise and the amazing tools they consistently provide, this is the first trailer for one of the games that has truly excited me. Why?&nbsp;<i>Forza Horizon 3&nbsp;</i>is set in Australia!</p><p>The world gameplay premiere showcased the Xbox One S as well as Xbox Play Anywhere by featuring drivers on the new console, the current Xbox One, on Windows with a steering wheel, and on Windows with a controller. Four player campaign co-op, the largest roster of cars ever seen in&nbsp;<i>Forza</i>, and a diverse open world with dynamic weather and traffic are just some of the things the new game offers.&nbsp;<b><i>Forza Horizon 3&nbsp;</i>will be coming to Xbox One and Windows 10 on September 27</b><b>.</b></p><p style="width: 651px;">&nbsp;</p><p><b><b><b><b>Recore</b></b></b></b><br></p><p>A new trailer for the fascinating new IP&nbsp;<i>Recore</i>&nbsp;introduced some of the game's characters and their roles. The stylish trailer included the funky sounds of MSTR ROGERS'&nbsp;<i>I'll Take You</i>, and a lot of exciting action, but it would've been nice to see more from this somewhat mysterious new game.<b>Recore will come to Xbox One and Windows 10 later this year</b></b><b>.</b></p><p style="width: 651px;">&nbsp;</p><p><b><b><b><b>Final Fantasy XV</b></b></b></b><br></p><p>A new gameplay demo aimed to show "how fast and fluid the battle system is" using the Trial of Titan as the setting. The video was quite rough, with overly chaotic combat and a dull-looking offence by Titan marring an otherwise ambitious title.&nbsp;<b><i>Final Fantasy XV</i> will be arriving on Playstation 4 and Xbox One&nbsp;(but seemingly&nbsp;not&nbsp;on Windows 10)&nbsp;on September 30</b><b>.</b></p><p style="width: 651px;">&nbsp;</p><p><b><b>The Division Underground Expansion Pack</b></b><br></p><p>A brief cinematic trailer played for the first of three&nbsp;<i>The Division</i>&nbsp;expansion packs, <i>Underground</i>. For more information, please see our Ubisoft conference coverage <a href="http://gamesharkreviews.com/news.php?t=Ubisoft_Press_Conference_at_E3_-_All_The_Details">here</a>.<b>&nbsp;<b><b><b><i>The Division Underground</i> will be released on Xbox One on June 28, before coming to PC and Playstation 4 on August 2</b></b></b></b><b>.</b></p><p style="width: 651px;">&nbsp;</p><p><b><b><b><b><b>Battlefield 1</b></b></b></b></b><br></p><p>Battlefield 1 will support 64-player battles, feature dynamic weather, and really cool-looking tanks. The trailer from the EA conference was shown - read more about that conference <a href="http://gamesharkreviews.com/news.php?t=EA_Press_Conference_at_E3_-_All_The_Details">here</a>. <b><i>Battlefield 1</i> releases on Xbox to EA Access users on October 13, and on October 21 for Xbox One, Playstation 4, and PC users.</b></p><p><b><b><b>&nbsp;</b></b></b></p><p><b><b><b>Xbox Live</b></b></b></p><p>Background music, language region independence, Clubs, and Cortana are all coming to Xbox Live, as well as Looking for Group which will allow players to look for people with shared goals to play multiplayer with them. Finally, Arena on Xbox Live was announced, which makes it easier to find multiplayer matches with friends or in public, as well as major global competitions in games such as <i>FIFA</i>.</p><p><b><b>&nbsp;</b></b></p><p><b><b><b>Minecraft</b></b></b></p>
<p>Now for the most confusing segment of the entire conference. <i>Minecraft</i> announces cross play, which will let Android, iOS, PC, and Xbox One players play together. This requires an Xbox Live account, and it is only available on <i>Minecraft Realms</i> (which means you or a friend needs to be willing to sacrifice $8 a month to play together privately). It’s not entirely clear which other consoles (such as Mac) are and aren’t included, or if cross play will ever include the Playstation community.</p><p>Additionally, <i>Minecraft Realms</i> can now be accessed even when the host is offline. Other announcements include officially released texture packs for Windows 10 and mobile users, and add-ons which will allow a certain but unknown degree of customization. Add-ons will come to Windows 10 and mobile users this year, while other aforementioned new features will come next year to multiple platforms. Good luck figuring out what it all means, and which features are coming to which platforms.</p><p><b><b>&nbsp;</b></b></p><p><b><b><b>Controller Customization</b></b></b></p><p>Players can now choose custom colours and styles for each control and section of a controller, as well as putting their gamertag on them. <b >The Xbox Design Lab tool is available now at <a href="xboxdesignlab.xbox.com">xboxdesignlab.xbox.com</a>.</b></p><p><b><b>&nbsp;</b></b></p><p><b><b><b>Inside</b></b></b></p><p><i >Limbo</i> developers Playdead showed a short cinematic teaser for their delayed game <i>Inside</i>. Nothing new was revealed, although a spider-like robot was partially shown towards the end. To celebrate the release, <i>Limbo</i> will be free on Xbox One. <b><i>Inside </i>is set to come out on June 29 for Xbox One and Windows 10.</b></p><p><b><b>&nbsp;</b></b></p><p><b><b><b>ID@XBOX &amp; We Happy Few</b></b></b></p><p>Games featured in this year’s annual montage include:</p><ul><li><i>Cuphead</i>, the long-awaited 30s cartoon game;</li><li><i>Outlast 2</i>, the first-person survival horror sequel;</li><li><i>Deliver Us The Moon</i>, which is a Steam Greenlit survival adventure in space;</li><li><i>Flint Hook</i>, the grappling hook based rogue-like platformer;</li><li><i>Far</i>, a strange 2.5D prize-winning adventure game, which seems inspired by <i>FTL</i>;</li><li><i>Slime Rancher</i>, the unusually popular farming shooter;</li><li><i>Shadow Tactics</i>, an isometric ninja strategy game;</li><li><i>Figment</i>, the surreal game based on “dreamlogic”;</li><li><i>The Culling</i>, the best-selling Hunger Games inspired FPS;</li><li><i>For The King</i>, crowdfunded turn-based roguelike adventuring;</li><li><i>Beacon</i>, a top-down sci-fi action roguelike;</li><li><i>Stardew Valley</i>, which combines farming with RPG elements;</li><li><i>Hand Of Fate 2</i>, the sequel to the critically-acclaimed deck-building game;</li><li><i>Below</i>, a procedurally-generated roguelike dungeon crawler;</li><li><i>Raiders of the Broken Planet</i>, an online action game from the developers of Castlevania;</li><li><i>Bloodstained: Ritual Of The Night</i>, a gothic exploration-based action platformer;</li><li><i>Yooka-Laylee</i>, which is similar to Banjo-Kazooie because it’s from the same developers;</li><li>and finally <i>Everspace</i>, a Steam Greenlit single-player roguelike space shooter.</li></ul><p>It was also announced that <i>ARK: Survival Evolved</i> is joining the Xbox Play Anywhere program, meaning it is already available on Windows 10 to people who own it on Xbox One.</p><p>A first-person adventure game called <i>We Happy Few</i> got a gameplay trailer introducing the creepy dystopian 60s world where everyone takes a drug called Joy to maintain a happy façade. <b style="font-weight: bold;"><b><i>We Happy Few </i>will be available on Xbox Game Preview on July 26, and on Xbox One, PC, Linux, and Mac later this year.</b></b></p><p><b><b>&nbsp;</b></b></p><p><b><b><b>Gwent</b></b></b></p><p>CD Projekt Red has announced <i>Gwent</i>, a standalone release of the popular card game from <i>The Witcher III</i><span>2 this week. </span><b>Tekken<i> 7</i> will be released in early 2017 for Xbox One, PC, and Playstation 4.</b></span></p><p><b><b>&nbsp;</b></b></p><p><b><b><b>Dead Rising 4</b></b></b></p><p>It snowed on the audience of E3 as a Christmassy trailer of <i>Dead Rising 4</i><span><span> was shown for the first time.

A game can be saved and quit on Xbox One, and then loaded from the same place on a Windows 10 PC. This segment also led into the segment on…</p><p><b><b>&nbsp;</b></b></p><p><b><b><b>Scalebound</b></b></b></p><p>A co-op gameplay trailer for <i>Scalebound</i><span><span> showed “the biggest boss fight Platinum Games has ever made”. At one point, the player can be seen riding a dragon and shooting fireballs at an underwater monster, then dropping to the ground and switching to arrows and energy bolts of some sort. </span><b><i>Scalebound</i> will be available on Xbox One and Windows 10 in 2017.</b></span></p><p><b><b>&nbsp;</b></b></p><p><b><b><b>Sea Of Thieves</b></b></b></p><p><i>Sea Of Thieves</i>, Rare’s multiplayer response to <i>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</i><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">, has not had much news since last year’s Microsoft conference at E3. But a new cinematic trailer has renewed the entire world’s immense excitement for this cartoonish pirate game which appears to include skeleton fights, deep sea diving, ship battles, and swordfights across ships. Some gameplay was shown featuring multiple crews working together to operate ships, exploring islands, and finally encountering each other for an epic fight. </span><b style="font-weight: bold;"><i>Sea Of Thieves </i>will come to Xbox One and Windows 10 later this year.</b></span></p><p><b><b>&nbsp;</b></b></p><p><b><b><b>State Of Decay 2</b></b></b></p><p>The latest zombie game <i>State Of Decay 2</i><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"> promises to be one of the better ones of recent years, with a persistent shared world and four-player co-op (and more players can be summoned with flares if the hordes become overwhelming.</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><i style="font-weight: bold;">State Of Decay </i>will be released on Xbox One and Windows 10 in 2017.</span></p><p><b><b>&nbsp;</b></b></p><p><b><b><b>Halo Wars 2</b></b></b></p><p>Not much was shown in the cinematic trailer for <i>Halo Wars 2</i><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">.
