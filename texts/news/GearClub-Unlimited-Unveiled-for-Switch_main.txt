<p>Microids and Eden Games have given us the&nbsp;first glimpse at <i>Gear.Club Unlimited</i>, a car racing game slated for a Q4 2017 release on the Nintendo Switch.<br></p><p><br></p><p>Already available on iOS and Android, <i>Gear.Club </i>is a racer that allows players to drive, customise and upgrade 30 real-world cars on over 200 tracks. While the mobile version is free-to-play with a bunch of optional&nbsp;microtransactions, the Switch version should be a fully fleshed out,&nbsp;stand-alone version with no restrictions on gameplay (hence the 'Unlimited' in its title right?)</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>What we do know is that there will be a full split screen mode, and it follows that extra shiny graphics and features will be implemented to make use of the extra grunt the Switch has. This is already on top of a healthy collection of cars and tracks, online racing, a performance shop to manage and upgrade your cars, and fully simulated physics across the cars and their respective components.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Given that this will be the Switch's first real-world racing game, it's already got a great head start thanks to Eden's great pedigree. With games such as the <i>V-Rally</i>&nbsp;and <i>Test Drive Unlimited</i>&nbsp;series behind them, they're certainly no stranger to solid racing games.&nbsp;<i><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Gear.</span>Club&nbsp;</i>itself<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"> is already quite popular on mobile devices, ranking as the #1 Racing game in over 145 countries at some stage or another. Here's to hoping that translates to the Switch!</span></p>
