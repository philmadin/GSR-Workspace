<p>Developer Team17 has announced that their hit turn-based strategy game Worms W.M.D. will be invading the Nintendo Switch in Q4 later this year.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Worms W.M.D. is already available on PS4, Xbox One, PC, Mac and Linux, so why get it on the Switch? Featuring support for single Joy-Con play in local multiplayer, as well as local wireless and online multiplayer, there have never been more ways to wage hilariously manic war both at home and on the go.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Dive into the campaign missions, levels, customisations and updates that made the game what it is today, including the Liberation content and the fan favourite Forts mode. The Switch version will also bring with it a new Space theme, new forts and new items to make your army your own.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>I personally think the Switch is the platform that Worms was made for, and cannot wait to un-pin that Holy Hand Grenade again - Haaaaaaaaaa-le-lu-jah!!!!</p>
