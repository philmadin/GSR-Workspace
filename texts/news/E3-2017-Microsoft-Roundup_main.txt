<p>Microsoft's E3 press briefing was jam packed with news and announcements - we've put together a roundup of the juiciest bits for you to digest.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Xbox One X</b></p><p><br></p><p></p><p></p><p>With so much information being teased and leaked over the last months under the moniker of Project Scorpio, this reveal confirmed what we already knew: 4K gaming and media consumption on the most powerful console on the market. What we didn't know however was the release date and price, and now we have both.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The Xbox One X (XOX &nbsp;anyone? -ed.) will release globally on the 7th of November for AU$649, and joins the Xbox One family of devices. It is not a whole new generation of consoles; instead it is a considerably more powerful and capable Xbox One, meaning all games and accessories will be compatible between the two. You'll find our full writeup on the new console <a href="http://gamesharkreviews.com/news.php?t=Xbox_One_X_Announced">here</a>.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>One X Updates &amp; Backwards Compatibility</b></p><p><br></p><p></p><p></p><p>35 games will receive free updates to bring them into the 4K era. Forza Horizon 3, Gears of War 4, Halo Wars 2, Minecraft and Rocket League are just some of the games that will be brought into line, and it's great to see those of us who have invested a lot of time in these games won't miss out with the new hardware.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Microsoft also announced that original Xbox games will be joining the 400+ strong library of backwards compatible Xbox 360 games later in the year. The only confirmed title so far is Crimson Skies, however we've been promised that all games in this program will receive a bit of loving so that they look and play better.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Game Announcements</b></p><p><br></p><p></p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dokpy_KIuyA">Forza Motorsport 7</a> was the first game showed off, running at a native 4K resolution at 60fps. Releasing on October 3 for Xbox One/PC and November 7 for the One X, Forza Motorsport 7 boasts over 700 cars, and finally includes Porsche. The weather and time of day are also now fully integrated as dynamic weather as opposed to the 'modes' in Forza Motorsport 6.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The trailer for Crackdown 3 gives us a hell of a lot of Terry Crews - here's to hoping he's actually in the game and not just a poster child for the release. It was originally announced back at E3 in 2014 with high aspirations but became less and less exciting as time went on. Fingers crossed it's now back on track as it releases on November 7 with the One X.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cUuKIpCM2o0">Assassin's Creed Origins</a> takes the series to Egypt, and looks ridiculous. You play a Magi (an Egyptian sheriff) who is armed with over-the-top powers such as possessing a bird for recon or leaping into an arrow to guide its trajectory. &nbsp;The short trailer suggests complex combat, RPG-esque loot and deep customisation options to boot, but we won't have more information until Ubisoft's upcoming conference. What we can tell you though is that it's releasing on October 27 on all the big platforms.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Rare, the company that brought us gems such as Golden Eye, Banjo-Kazooie and the Donkey Kong series are back with new IP in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rbE8BnO6oug">Sea of Thieves</a>. Whether you're piloting a ship with friends, working with strangers to find treasure or intercepting vessels to plunder their loot, this is shaping up to be a swash-buckling blast. With a release window of early 2018, this is definitely one to watch - just look at the quality of that water!</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The final piece of news was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EL5GSfs9fi4">Anthem</a>, the latest game from BioWare. If the gameplay footage is anything to go by, it looks like it's going to be competing with Destiny - RPG elements are everywhere and tends to favour co-operative gameplay. Little else is known at this stage other than you have access to jetpacks and is set for a 2018 release.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>For more information, you can view the full briefing below.</p><p></p><p></p>
