So this one is a big surprise! Out of nowhere at the beginning of their conference Bethesda drop one hell of a bomb with the reveal of Quake Champions, the latest game in the Quake series.<br><br>From the information we've received so far, Quake Champions appears to be an Arena style FPS much like its old school predecessors and designed for all skill levels.<br><br>The game will focus on fast paced, frenetic gun play and feature a large character roster each with their own unique abilities and playstyles.<br><br>I'm definitely excited about this one! More information (and hopefully some gameplay) will be revealed at QuakeCon in the next few months so stay tuned! <br>
