Independent developer Zero Gravity today at 6pm GMT launches their debut first-person space survival multiplayer title <i>Hellion</i> on Steam Early Access for $24.99/?19.99/EUR22.99. In the Hellion solar system, all in-game objects from planets and moons to ships and stations abide by Newtonian physics and full orbital mechanics. Players have to survive in the most hostile environment known to man by protecting themselves from the vacuum of space, gathering scarce life support resources, maintaining their base and interacting with other players.<br><br><br>"Launching Hellion on Steam Early Access is a big step forward for us", said Marko Smiljanic, Creative Director at Zero Gravity. "The PC player base is extremely varied and demanding so having access to it during the development process allows us shape Hellion into what sci-fi fans really want".<br><br><br>The first <i>Hellion</i> Early Access build allows players to salvage derelict station modules in order to obtain parts and resources to build their base and upgrade their own equipment. <i>Hellion</i> colonists can also choose to EVA mine raw resources and refine them into fuel, air and crafting components. Survivors have to exchange the safety of the ship for a thrilling EVA experience as they explore the ruins of mankind's first interstellar colony in search of intel, resources and equipment. <br><br><br>Players will experience the unique feel of zero gravity movement without restrictions and master the use of inertia for maximum benefit. The Hellion Early Access build offers free multiplayer interactions so players are able to play as a lone wolf, team up to pilot multi-crew ships with realistic navigation, or engage in PvP close quarters combat.<br><br><br>Future patches will add fully modular ship and equipment customization, ship to ship combat, asteroid ship mining, gas giant harvesting, realistic wound mechanics, suit damage and degradation, as well as allow building and hacking a security system and much more.
