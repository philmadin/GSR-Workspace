<p><br></p><p>Hey World Warriors!</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>As announced on the Nintendo Switch Presentation 2017 in Tokyo, <i>Ultra Street Fighter II: The Final Challengers</i>, is coming to the Nintendo Switch!</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Capcom and Nintendo have a long history together, going all the way back to <i>Street Fighter II</i> on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1991, so we are happy to bring the newest edition of <i>Street Fighter II</i> to the Nintendo Switch.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>For the first time in nearly 20 years, since <i>Super Street Fighter II, </i>two new characters join the fight<i>; </i>Evil Ryu and Violent Ken. This version of Ryu has succumbed to the Satsui no Hado and is now obsessed with fighting in order to prove he is the strongest. His former honorable self has been purged, allowing him to enjoy absolute power and embrace an unquenchable bloodthirst for battle.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Violent Ken is the result of M. Bison kidnapping and brainwashing Ken, enhancing his abilities with Psycho Power and twisting his brotherly rivalry with Ryu into hatred. Violent Ken is more ruthless, aggressive, and fearless with moves that feature purple flames instead of his signature fire.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Choose between classic pixel-art graphics for a retro nostalgia trip, or enjoy HD graphics created by UDON Entertainment.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Utilizing the system’s unique Joy-Con controllers, players can challenge each other in Arcade Mode, or team-up to both fight against the CPU at the same time.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Nintendo Switch TV,&nbsp;Tabletop, and Handheld&nbsp;modes allow you to play&nbsp;<i>Ultra Street Fighter II</i>&nbsp;at home or on-the-go with brand new single-player and multiplayer modes.
