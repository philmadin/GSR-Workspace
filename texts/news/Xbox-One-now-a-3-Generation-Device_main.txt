<p>Back at E3, Microsoft announced an expansion of their existing backwards-compatibility program for later in the year. It is officially now later in the year, and Microsoft has been true to their word - starting today, you'll be able to play three generations of games on the Xbox One family of devices.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>There are 13 original Xbox games releasing tomorrow that can be played through discs you already own or purchased digitally through the Microsoft Store. These are original games, so services that were previously available such as online multiplayer and achievements will not work. There is still the full offline multiplayer and system-link functionality which for many will be reason enough to head down memory lane.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The first curated batch of original games can be found below, with a second curated list releasing in Autumn 2018 (for those of us in the southern hemisphere).</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p></p><ul><li><i>BLACK</i></li></ul><i><br></i><ul><li><i>BloodRayne 2</i></li></ul><i><br></i><ul><li><i>Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge</i></li></ul><i><br></i><ul><li><i>Dead to Rights</i></li></ul><i><br></i><ul><li><i>Fuzion Frenzy</i></li></ul><i><br></i><ul><li><i>Grabbed by the Ghoulies</i></li></ul><i><br></i><ul><li><i>King of Fighters Neowave</i></li></ul><i><br></i><ul><li><i>Ninja Gaiden Black</i></li></ul><i><br></i><ul><li><i>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</i></li></ul><i><br></i><ul><li><i>Psychonauts</i></li></ul><i><br></i><ul><li><i>Red Faction II</i></li></ul><i><br></i><ul><li><i>Sid Meier's Pirates!</i></li></ul><i><br></i><ul><li><i>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</i></li></ul><p></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>To coincide with the Xbox One X release on November 7, Microsoft will also be bumping selected Xbox 360 games up to 4K resolution with expanded colour details. Thanks to some bloke called Heutchy, the team at Xbox have a method of leveraging the extra power of the newer consoles to help the emulator present the very best version of the game. All of this is done without touching the game code, which is no mean feat!!&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><i style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Assassin's Creed, Fallout 3, Halo 3</i> and <i style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Oblivion</i> will be joining the enhanced catalogue, and&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">it's also worth noting that they'll look better on the One and One S too.&nbsp;</span></p>
