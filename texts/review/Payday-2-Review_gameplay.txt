<i>Payday 2 </i>is difficult to judge when gameplay is concerned. Some features are excellent and incredibly well implemented while others feel at odds with the nature of the game or sometimes outright broken.<p><br></p><p><br></p><p>What <i>Payday 2 </i>does well is variety. There are dozens of heists, many of which are wildly different, even more guns, both primary and secondary, melee weapons, throw-able weapons and various deployables. <br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Add to this, is a levelling system to unlock items as well as almost one hundred skills, numerous perk decks and masks, each of which can be customised, and you have an awful lot of content. But that's not all. There's stealth heists, loud heists, heists which can start quiet and go loud, a bunch of characters to play as and a loot system that gives masks and mask customisation items as well as mods for weapons such as silencers and sights. If it's value for money you want, <i>Payday 2 </i>has you covered.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Unfortunately there are a number of issues that plague the game. Occasional bugs, confusing AI, both friendly and enemy, poor servers and more DLC than you can point a stick at. Add to this terrible design decisions such as having to hold a button to interact with anything, a poorly placed tutorial and a difficulty curve that makes no sense. While a lot of these issues are slowly being fixed by the developers, it is worth noting that a number of them have been fixed by the modding community; most notably the friendly AI and the amount of loot the player can carry. If you want to improve your experience, they're worth checking out.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Most of the time you'll be blasting your way through hordes of SWAT, tossing around various valuables from gold all the way to meth and cocaine or planning the best way to sneak in and out without being seen. It's a lot of fun and when it works, it really works, fortunately this is most of the time. But the opposite is true. When <i>Payday 2 </i>breaks, it breaks hard and can cause a lot of frustration.</p>
