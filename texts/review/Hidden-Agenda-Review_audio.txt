As has come to be expected from games like this, the audio is impeccable. The voice acting is on point in the way every scene is set and every line is delivered with exactly the right amount of emotion that is needed to progress the narrative.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The music is also perfect, providing a great mix of tension and intrigue that leaves the player both wanting more and fearing the decision that they just made. &lt;br&gt;
