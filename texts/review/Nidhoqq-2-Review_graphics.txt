This is one ugly looking game. The characters are positively repulsive, the Wurm is gnarly to say the least and it&#039;s just generally unpleasant The levels are varied and range from the insides of giant monsters to beach fronts. And it&#039;s great. Sure, the art style is somewhat repugnant but it&#039;s equally hilarious so it all balances out in the end. While it&#039;s a far cry from the simple visuals of the original, and some elements occasionally get lost in the chaos, it still feels like it should. That is to say, utterly mental.
