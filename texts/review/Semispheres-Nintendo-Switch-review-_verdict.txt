&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-AU&quot;&gt;As someone who usually gets extremely frustrated playing puzzle games, I found &lt;i&gt;Semispheres&lt;/i&gt; unexpectedly relaxing. I loved the ambient tones guiding you as you progress through the beautifully designed levels, and I honestly wish it wasn&#039;t so short. &lt;i&gt;Semispheres&lt;/i&gt; is full of challenging puzzles, and I really think it brings some fresh ideas to the genre. So if you&#039;re a lover of puzzle games, this is certainly one to consider. Especially on the Switch where it doubles as a fun and sometimes stressful co-op.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
