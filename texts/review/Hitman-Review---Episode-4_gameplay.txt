&lt;p&gt;2016&#039;s &lt;i&gt;Hitman &lt;/i&gt;game has a unique yet repetitive formula - targets to kill are either hidden from the public or roaming in view of the public; opportunities are presented to draw them out or kill them from afar; Agent 47 executes and escapes. While this mission is no different, the unique layout of the map and the challenge of getting into the correct wing of the hotel add a splash of variety to this tired formula. Opportunities seem to make you work harder to get into these highly populated areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I must also make special mention of the interactions with staff. Upon entering the hotel, you&#039;re met with better service than most people experience in their lifetime. Staff members welcome you graciously, compliment whichever starting suit you are wearing, and even escort you to your room. But upon walking back out wearing the staff uniform, staff become slightly more hostile, ordering you to take requested items to rooms and to stand up straight. It&#039;s nothing major, but these small touches help enormously in making the world more immersive and fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;
