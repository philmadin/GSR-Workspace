The music in this game perfectly sets the atmosphere for wherever you are, whether you’re just chilling in Nook’s Homes or out designing a residence. It’s the perfect background tune but one of the catchiest pieces plays whenever you’re seeing a completed house/facility.  <br />

K.K Slider’s entire catalogue can be unlocked through interacting with villagers, and you can groove out to them wherever you produce a stereo. Perhaps one of the cutest parts is if you’re playing one of K.K’s songs, you can put a villager in front of a microphone, and they’ll sing along.<br />
