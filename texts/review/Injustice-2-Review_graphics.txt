&lt;i&gt;Injustice 2&lt;/i&gt; looks great, with the detail in the characters and the environments making it feel like this game was a labour of love for the fans. The arenas are rich with detail and small Easter Eggs if you look hard enough, with character customization adding another dimension to each member of the &lt;i&gt;Injustice 2&lt;/i&gt; roster, as the player can change any characters appearance to make them the character that they want them to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Injustice 2&lt;/i&gt; itself looks amazing, and in my opinion is the best looking fighting game made for the current generation consoles. At the time of writing, I haven&#039;t noticed any graphical glitches, which tells me that &lt;i&gt;Injustice 2&lt;/i&gt; was not rushed to be released.&lt;br&gt;
