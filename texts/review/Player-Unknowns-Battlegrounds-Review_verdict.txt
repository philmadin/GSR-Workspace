From the outside looking in,&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;PUBG&lt;/i&gt; is graphically flawed, overcomplicated, and at times choppy, which makes you wonder why so many people play it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;But damn it! it&#039;s the most fun I&#039;ve had in quite some time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This game will make you laugh, scream, cry and leave you with so much anxiety and euphoria that you will think you&#039;ve just lived a classic thriller. &lt;i&gt;PUBG&lt;/i&gt; is truly something that anyone with an Xbox One or PC should experience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
