Rugby League Live 4&#039;s soundtrack is a great mix of rock and pop songs that will get your blood pumping. The commentary for Rugby League Live 4 is surprisingly responsive and follows the action rather well, and features commentators from both the British Super League and the NRL.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The crowd of Rugby League Live 4 sounds amazingly&amp;nbsp;unlike other sports games in that they sound like a real crowd at a real game (aside from the lack of &quot;Bulls**t!&quot; chants). Much to my delight, they don&#039;t do that annoying &quot;D-FENCE!&quot;&amp;nbsp;chant that you hear every 5 minutes in the EA NFL games.&lt;br&gt;
