&lt;i&gt;Injustice 2&lt;/i&gt;&#039;s gameplay further builds and improves on what worked in &lt;i&gt;Injustice: Gods Among Us&lt;/i&gt;; combos feel smoother and faster, and environmental grabs don&#039;t have the half second buffer time that &lt;i&gt;Injustice: Gods Among Us&lt;/i&gt; had. &lt;i&gt;Injustice 2&lt;/i&gt; boasts a 29 character roster, with 9 more characters to be added as downloadable content; this ensures that no matter your fighting game skill level, there is always a character for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Injustice 2&lt;/i&gt; has an RPG-style progression system, meaning that each character can be leveled up, and you can earn certain clothing or weapons from playing the game. These clothing or weapons are earned by opening crates; adding stat boosts to a character and even changing the appearance of a character, all of these can be accessed through the character customization menu once that character is at the proper level.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Injustice 2&lt;/i&gt; also introduces the multiverse mode which is kind of like the tower battles from &lt;i&gt;Mortal Kombat X&lt;/i&gt;, and is a great way to level up your favorite character and earn crates, as well as providing a new challenge for players. The multiverse mode also gives players daily and weekly challenges to be completed, providing infinite challenges across infinite Earths.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;
