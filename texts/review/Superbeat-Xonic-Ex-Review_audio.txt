Ranging from techno and R&amp;amp;B to K-pop and even metal, the solid offering of 65+ tracks here is well curated - there is something here for everyone. The game sounds surprisingly good through the Switch speakers, but like all rhythm games, deserves to be upgraded to good headphones or a sound system if you have the option. Don&#039;t expect to hear songs that you know, but how often have you recognised any songs in a rhythm game?
