<i>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</i> is a great game for those seeking easy scares and cheesy horror that the series is known for. Completed in nine hours, the story holds up long enough with the end falling short of expectations. The game remains consistent throughout, with enough difficulty to offer a challenge.<br>
