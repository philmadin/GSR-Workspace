Conan Exiles is an example of multiplayer open world survival games done right. The survival isn&#039;t so overbearing that it becomes a chore, nor is it so easy that it might as well not exist.&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combat is solid yet simple. The crafting and building is easy to learn but surprisingly deep. However, while I do enjoy the game, I can&#039;t really recommend it, at least for anyone looking for online play. If you want to go solo, have fun but if you prefer to run with the pack, hold off until it&#039;s more stable.&lt;/p&gt;
