<p>The game play is where DOOM truly shines. The game harkens back to its predecessors through the fast paced nature of the movement, combat and pickups, whilst also enhancing the experience with more modern design choices such as upgrade trees and open ended level design.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>With double jumping and the ability to mantle certain environmental elements, traversing through the levels feels much more varied and interesting as opposed to the classic corridor shooter recipe.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Using this classic yet improved movement system becomes your greatest offence and defence during combat. Strafing in all directions to avoid incoming fire whilst being able to close the gap and nail a demon with a shotgun blast becomes the staple in almost every situation and it never feels boring or repetitive thanks to the menagerie of demonic creatures and the weapons you are given.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Some standard modern FPS design choices are missing here, such as reloading and regenerating health; however these are instead replaced with ammo, health and armour pickups that can be found scattered throughout every level. These pickups can also be gained through “Glory Kill” executions and killing demons in other gruesome ways, allowing the combat to continue to flow even if you find yourself low on resources.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The level of customisation and choice in DOOM is surprising,allowing you to spend both suit and weapon upgrades that provide meaningful enhancements to your play style. Suit upgrades allow you bonuses such as faster weapon switching and power-up enhancements while weapon upgrades grant you up to two mods for each gun with their own separate augmentations and masteries.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>A separate Rune System also finds its way into the game.Runes are only obtainable through Rune Trials that are scattered throughout levels which usually demand a certain amount of kills with a certain type of weapon in a certain amount of time. There are a total of 12 Runes in the game, each with its own effect such as increasing the amount of time enemies are staggered, or increasing the amount of pickups dropped from dead enemies.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The open ended level design is hands down one of the best new additions to the series. Each level is a large, multi-layered experience filled with upgrades, pickups and secrets. Exploring each level to its full potential allows you to find everything you need to tackle the encounters ahead,especially when playing on the harder difficulties. And nothing brings a bigger smile to your face than seeing a secret door open to a room covered in classic Doom textures.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Lastly, there is also the inclusion of a multiplayer mode in DOOM developed in cooperation with Certain Affinity, a handful of developers known for their work on multiplayer shooters like Halo and Call of Duty. While the addition of multiplayer helps to increase the longevity of the title, it ends up feeling rather forced and fails to provide anything new or interesting to shake things up.</p>
