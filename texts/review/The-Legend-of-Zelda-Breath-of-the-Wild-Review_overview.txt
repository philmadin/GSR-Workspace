Finally, after nearly three years since its announcement, &lt;i&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;/i&gt; is here!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nintendo&#039;s final game for the Wii U, as well as its flagship launch title for the Switch, much has made of this highly ambitious sequel to the revered fantasy franchise - and now that I&#039;ve put it through its paces, I can confidently say that it matches the quality of &lt;i&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In fact, it may have surpassed it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
