Warhammer 40000 has never looked this good. As troops stomp across the landscape they kick up dust, plasma bolts fizzle and spark as they fly between armies, Tyranid spores explode in grotesque clouds of acrid gas and jump packs flare as Assault Marines descend upon their enemies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The units are incredibly detailed, especially for a strategy. Space Marines are covered in holy sigils, the Tyranids&#039; bio-mechanical nature is beautiful and everything else looks just as good. Dawn of War II might just be the most detailed RTS on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
