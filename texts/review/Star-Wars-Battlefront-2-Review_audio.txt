The audio is truly the standout for this game. Everything sounds as if it&#039;s come straight from the movies (because it most likely is), from the distinctive sound of a Storm Trooper&#039;s blaster wildly missing you, to the hum of an idle Lightsaber. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every audio cue and sound feels like they have been created to give the player full immersion and the most complete audio experience any fan could ask for.&lt;br&gt;
