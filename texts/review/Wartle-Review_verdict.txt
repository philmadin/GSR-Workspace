All up, I think that &lt;i&gt;Wartile&lt;/i&gt; is a fun game that is easy to pick up and play. It&#039;s still in Early Access, so a work in progress which should be amazing once the full release comes out. If you like 3D RTS board games then &lt;i&gt;Wartile&lt;/i&gt; is the game for you, and at $20 USD it is properly priced for all to enjoy.&lt;br&gt;
