&lt;p&gt;Combining the graphical strengths of the Mario and Rayman/Rabbids universes works just as well as you would expect. The world is full of character and charm; colours are vibrant and animations are slicker than a banana on a race track.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interface also does a fantastic job of conveying what&#039;s going on and what your options are. Everything is clearly set out and well defined, meaning you are never short of the information you need.&lt;/p&gt;
