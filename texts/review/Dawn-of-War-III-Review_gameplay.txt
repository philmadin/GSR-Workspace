The gameplay remains largely unchanged from the beta which, as everyone should know, wasn&#039;t a beta but more of a server test. The biggest difference is all the elites and doctrines are no longer available from the moment you begin. They need to be purchased with skulls, the games currency. This system is awful. The doctrines lock off series staples like move and shoot behind an incredibly slow progression system. The game would be far more enjoyable if these doctrines were integrated instead of being unlocked and the elites were all available from the get go.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one gamemode, Power Core, is fun enough but doesn&#039;t have much longevity. There still isn&#039;t a whole lot of units, defensive options and it&#039;s riddled with bugs that range from infuriating to game breaking.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s still pretty fun and the AI in solo/coop is challenging enough. The ability to play with friends against a non-competitive opponents is something the beta was sorely missing but it really is enjoyable. Overall, gameplay is solid, if lacking in content.&lt;/p&gt;
