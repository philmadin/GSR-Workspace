For the first time in the game so far, the audio in this episode is not worthy of a perfect score. It&#039;s certainly still got the atmospheric audio, acoustics, and background chatter nailed. But a couple of times while playing this episode, voices seemed ridiculously muffled or distorted, and sounds didn&#039;t seem to be as loud as they should be compared to others in the environment. Perhaps there are a couple of bugs that need ironing out.
