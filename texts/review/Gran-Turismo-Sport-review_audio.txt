Gran Turismo Sport carries on the series standard of cars that sound so real - your neighbours will think you just won the lottery. &amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The music selection for &lt;i&gt;Gran Turismo&lt;/i&gt; is superb, mixing both classical and electronic sounds to create its own unique feel while the player is either exploring the plethora of options available on the main menu, or driving around the track pretending to be Michael Schumacher. &lt;br&gt;
