Once again, the audio here is excellent. The Necron and Tau receive their own music with both being easily distiguishable from the rest of the score. The sound design for the Necrons is notable as they clank and stomp about and the Tau energy weapons sizzle with ferocity. Overall, it&#039;s really solid.
