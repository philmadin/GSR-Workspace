The best part about <i>Apollo Justice</i> is easily the music. Composed by Toshihiko Horiyama and Hideki Okugawa, every track perfectly suits the game and the section where it's played. Klavier's theme, <i>Klavier Gavin~ Guilty Love</i>, is exciting and Lamiror's theme, <i>Lamiror ~ Landscape Painter In Sound</i>, is soothing and relaxing to listen to.
