&lt;i&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/i&gt; still has many things to iron out. The team-orientated focus has shifted slightly, where you can now obtain high-level gear on your own. There are both daily and weekly public events on each of the planets that offer gear, engrams and weapons upon completion. Strikes aren&#039;t as fun as they once were. They are a mix of platforming skill and coordination with enemies now scaled to your current level. You lose a sense of accomplishment, as the time spent on gearing your character feels wasted. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The guns feel no different from one another. The only difference is the stats and this applies to your personal gear as well. They seem to lack uniqueness and this is apparent with the heavy weapons category. These guns are supposed to be powerful and by including Shotguns and Snipers into this category, it limits strategy and playstyle. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The higher you climb, the less you stand out as a player. By being locked into an initial default subclass, you are forced to seek out the other two subclasses in random drops. You should have been able to choose from the beginning of the game for which class you wanted to be; thereafter unlocking each as you complete them.&lt;br&gt;
