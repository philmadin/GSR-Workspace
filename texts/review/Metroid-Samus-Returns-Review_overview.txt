A remake of the 1991 Game Boy title, &lt;i&gt;Metroid II: Samus Returns&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Metroid: Samus Returns&lt;/i&gt; (sans the II) is Samus Aran&#039;s first adventure on Nintendo&#039;s popular stereoscopic handheld, and the first traditional &lt;i&gt;Metroid&lt;/i&gt; game in seven years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Considering the &lt;i&gt;27 year&lt;/i&gt; gap between the two games, it&#039;s safe to assume there have been a few changes in this remake - but how does the game itself hold up in today&#039;s world?&lt;br&gt;
