<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: start;">Quadrilateral Cowboys story is bare bones at the best of times. It follows a group of friends as they plan and undertake various heists.</p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: start;"><br></p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: start;"><br></p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: start;">We are given very little information as to who they are, why they do what they do or even to the world in which they live. It is unfortunate as it feels like a story is hiding somewhere beneath the surface and whenever something does rise to the top it only serves to confuse and bewilder.</p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: start;"><br></p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: start;"><br></p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: start;">We are shown many interesting and unique things, from jetbikes to space elevators but all come without context or reason, despite feeling like it should have some, even just enough to inform the player where they.</p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: start;"><br></p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: start;"><br></p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: start;">The world that has been constructed is most definitely and interesting one to behold with strange building stacked atop each other, facilities suspended in low gravity environments and archaic 80's style technology scattered throughout but unfortunately it is all left to the players imagination rather than given meaning through the game itself.</p>
