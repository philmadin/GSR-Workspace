I don&#039;t think that I&#039;ve ever had a game that has taken me on an emotional journey as much as &lt;i&gt;Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus&lt;/i&gt; did - in just the first fifteen minutes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once I got past those harrowing first fifteen minutes, what I found was a masterfully crafted roller coaster of a story. The story&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;takes&lt;i&gt; the &lt;/i&gt;main protagonist B.J Blazkowicz from a broken shell of the man that he was in &lt;i&gt;The New Order&lt;/i&gt; to the Terror Billy, a Nazi-hating death machine who suffers from main protagonist syndrome and likes to come up with new destructive ways to destroy the Nazi regime once and for all.&lt;br&gt;
