&lt;p&gt;At first glance, exploring ancient Egypt through the eyes of the last Medjay, and being crowned as protector of all of Egypt by Cleopatra herself, may seem like a great story. And it has some great moments such as Shadya&#039;s storyline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the end, it&#039;s a story about a straight male protagonist who loses a loved one and tracks down all who were possibly involved in their death to exact his revenge.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;A story featuring fascinating historical characters such as Cleopatra, but a generic one nonetheless. Aya adds some depth to the story, but not without starting the game as simply Bayek&#039;s wife, a woman we know nothing about who occasionally shows up to have sex with our protagonist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with all &lt;i&gt;Assassin&#039;s Creed &lt;/i&gt;games, the ending is drawn out (this time, far too long) and the overall story ranges from boring to confusing to glacially slow. The side quests often have interesting stories to tell, but it seems like almost all of them have some form of plot twist, and it gets old, fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the modern day storyline is a waste of time that&#039;s probably just trying to set up sequels.&lt;/p&gt;
