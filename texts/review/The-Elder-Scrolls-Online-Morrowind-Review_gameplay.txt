&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest drawcards for this expansion is a new class called the Warden. This class is extremely OP as area healer, and a solid all-rounder - has a cool bear too.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently holding over 50 hours worth of content, this expansion is definitely worth the money considering. For me, I didn&#039;t feel connected to the storyline, so the team dungeons were my getaway.&lt;/p&gt;
