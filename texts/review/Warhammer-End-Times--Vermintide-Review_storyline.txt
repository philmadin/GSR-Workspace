Vermintide is set, as the name suggests, in the End Times. Based in the city of Ubersreik, a town overrun with Skaven (Large, rat-like creatures.) it is your job to complete a number of objectives, whilst fighting off seemingly infinite hordes of various nasties, all trying to enact your impending doom. There are five classes to choose from, ranging from a Dwarf to a Wizard, all with their own unique skillsets and talents that, if utilised well as a team, make progress a lot easier. The story unfolds as you make your way through the 10+ levels, effectively telling the story in real-time, with each character reacting to major events within the game in their own personal way.
