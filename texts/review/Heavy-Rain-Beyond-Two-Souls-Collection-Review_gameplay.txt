Gameplay within these two titles follows quick-time events, minimal direct control and choices that influence characters actions and outcomes. <br><br><i>Heavy Rain</i> utilises button mashing and tricky button combos to perform actions. Every little movement needs input and even sitting on a chair can take a few goes. At the time it was quirky, but now it feels bloated. Movement is wonky resulting in your character struggling to walk in a straight line.The character Norman Jayden makes use of an interesting, if out of place, detective mechanic with his Ari glasses. Highlighting clues in the area then creating virtual landscapes and holographics to interact with and piece the puzzle together.<br><br>While HR used a standard process for its actions, <i>Beyond Two Souls </i>makes it up as it goes. Every new action has new feedback that is sometimes unclear. This is most evident in scenarios such as fist fights. Time slows down as Jodie throws a punch and the player needs to move the stick in the direction that Jodie is punching. It can be unclear which direction you are needed to move, especially if you are on the receiving end.Controlling Aiden however is fun and creates a feeling of power. Early on, a party with some “friends“ can allow Aiden to be unleashed on the guests. The rage that Jodie would be feeling is expressed well by allowing you to unleash Aiden’s power.
