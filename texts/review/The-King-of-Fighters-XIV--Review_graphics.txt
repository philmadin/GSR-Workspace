<br>A main issue during previews, the visuals for <i>King of Fighters XIV</i> are a little threadbare. Character models are basic (I'd even argue last-gen quality), but the action is silky-smooth - and that's what ultimately matters. The characters themselves may not be as recognisable as those of <i>Street Fighter</i> or <i>Mortal Kombat</i>, but they're colourful enough, and are diverse enough so that you'll easily find a favourite or two.<br><br><br>Mine's Terry Bogard.<br><br><br>
