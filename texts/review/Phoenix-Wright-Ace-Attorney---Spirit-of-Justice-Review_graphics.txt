The animations of the characters along with the detailed backgrounds push the 3DS to its limits. This may cause some frame lagging but it’s worth it to view everything in full-3D, all throughout the game.</font></font></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font style="font-size: 10pt" size="2">Along with the return of the anime cut scenes, there are 3D cut scenes as well. These cut scenes provide a new perspective to the game and give it some depth. It’s great to see Phoenix and Apollo moving around in the courtroom like this and makes the world as a whole feel more‘alive’. These cuts cenes also deliver some great scenes for the inevitable villain breakdowns.</font></font></p>
