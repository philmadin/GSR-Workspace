The music in this game is what kept me going back for more. It may not exactly be the most suitable music for this art style or gameplay, but it certainly makes it worth playing the game.&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As ridiculous as it sounds the soothing music kept me calm, and in turn helped me control the spirit animal better!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
