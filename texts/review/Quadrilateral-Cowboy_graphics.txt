<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: start;">Running on the idTech4 engine, Quadrilateral Cowboy runs, for the most part, very well. I experienced a number frame rate drops and two crashes, though by release I would hope those issues would have been fixed.</p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: start;"><br></p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: start;"><br></p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: start;">As for its visual appeal it draws up a strange style, the people resembling, well, quadrilaterals as do a number of other things. Other items such as the Weevil are rounded, with no sharp edges and some objects seem to have no style whatsoever, simply resembling their real world counterparts. While this style is by no means a bad choice, it is in many ways endearing, it suffers through its inconsistency though one cannot be too harsh on a game almost entirely developed by a single individual.</p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: start;"><br></p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: start;"><br></p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: start;">It displays a good number of environments, each of which has their own distinct look and feel, some looking very nice, if more than a little sparse. The game suffers from a lack of backgrounds with the player often finding themselves atop a tower or riding a train surrounded by nothing but empty grey space. I would have loved to have seen something, anything, to fill in the emptiness, to build a better world for the player to inhabit.</p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: start;"><br></p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: start;"><br></p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: start;">For what it is, Quadrilateral Cowboy looks decent, offering the occasional nice view or quirky object but nothing that is worth noting, it has its own style as do many other games, it's nothing special.</p>
