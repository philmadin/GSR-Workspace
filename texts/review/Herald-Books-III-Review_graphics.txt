The 3D world has quite a nice charm to it in spite of a severely lacking polygon count. The 2D portraits in conversation though are true works of art. Beautifully finished with subtle animations that change with the tone of the conversation, they do a great job of conveying how the character is feeling and are a treat to look at.
