&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to describe the gameplay is to call it an interactive comic. Each page begins with an automated element followed by the character being caught or shot due to the order of the subsequent frames. By re-arranging the panels, you change how the character moves through the environment, with the goal of finishing the page in one piece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where Framed really shines. Understanding what to do involves simple logic, but the manner in which it&#039;s executed is simply sublime. Each panel is fully animated, and what happens in that panel depends on where it&#039;s placed. One panel may have the character entering from the top floor, but put a panel before it with a set of stairs and they will now enter from the bottom.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some puzzles involve two or three frames, others are much larger. As the game progresses you&#039;re introduced to the concepts of pinned panels, rotating panels and panels that can be re-used. Some involve bigger panels that change the order in which the character moves through the comic depending entirely on how they&#039;re orientated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real beauty is that the difficulty is always just right. You feel genuinely rewarded each time you complete a scene, and you do so without wanting to throw your phone down the toilet.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
