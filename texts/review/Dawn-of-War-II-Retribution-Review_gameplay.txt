While the base gameplay hasn&#039;t changed much, &lt;i&gt;Retribution&lt;/i&gt;While the base gameplay hasn&#039;t changed much, Retribution introduced a sixth race in the form of the Imperial Guard and a new game mode, Last Stand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To begin with, the Imperial Guard are hands down, the most interesting race in the game. They have a strong focus on powerful vehicles, as well as the ability to amass large amounts of disposable infantry. But where they shine is in defence. The ability to build cover and turrets, while fielding heavy weapons teams means that a good player can deny whole sections of the map to their enemy. While their early game units are easily beaten by the likes of Chaos and Space Marines, they have easily the most powerful tanks around. Once you get the hang of them you can crush your enemy 100 corpses at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last Stand is an entirely new mode to the franchise and it&#039;s quite a lot of fun. While it is little more than a cooperative hero survival game it has enough depth through both its difficulty, a levelling system and different arenas that I found myself coming back to it again and again. It&#039;s also available separately as &lt;i&gt;The Last Standalone&lt;/i&gt; which is cheap enough to justify its existence as an easy pickup-and-play game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as gameplay is concerned, &lt;i&gt;Retribution&lt;/i&gt; is the most refined of all in this series. It brings a new race, a new game mode and numerous small changes that overall make it a more enjoyable experience when playing against AI or other players.&lt;/p&gt;
