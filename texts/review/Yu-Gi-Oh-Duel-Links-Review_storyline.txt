&lt;p&gt;There isn&#039;t much story in this app. When you first open it, you&#039;re asked which character you&#039;d prefer to play as, Yami Yugi or Seto Kaiba. Depending on who you pick, you get a basic deck to start you out and their signature card. For Yami, it&#039;s the Dark Magician and for Kaiba, it&#039;s the Blue Eyes White Dragon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After learning the basic mechanics of the game, you&#039;re pretty much left to your own devices. Characters from the anime show up, such as Joey Wheeler, Mai Valentine, Bandit Keith, and Maximillion Pegasus, as you level up or complete certain tasks. You can unlock these characters and their cards by fulfilling a number of tasks. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are events every so often in the app that can correlate to storylines in the show. For example, the current one is &lt;i&gt;The Destiny Board of Doom&lt;/i&gt;, which has you Duelling Yami Bakura and earning Ten-Sided Dice for prizes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
