The visuals are really the only noticeable difference within &lt;i style=&quot;white-space: normal;&quot;&gt;StarCraft Remastered&lt;/i&gt; and, at first, they don&#039;t seem all that impressive. That is until you discover the ability to revert to the original settings, at which point you realise how far they have in fact come. Units that used to be nothing more than a blob of pixels now have detail, not a lot but enough to make them distinguishable. This upgrade really is the remastered editions only selling point. So if you&#039;re tired of eye bleed, it&#039;s worth checking out.
