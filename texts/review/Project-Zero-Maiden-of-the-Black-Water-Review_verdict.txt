Project Zero: Maiden of the Black Water is a good game for fans of the series. Everything here works as usual, and innovations like the Game Pad and the wetness meter are welcome. Still, if youâ€™re not a fan of the franchise, then nothing here will convince you to take the plunge. One for traditional J-horror enthusiasts.
