For the most part, this is exactly what a remaster should be. Fun and a close adherence to the original game which updates certain elements to make it more enjoyable for the current players. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aside from the from the outdated camera system which feels like it&#039;s stuck in the mud, and the repetitive combat, &lt;i&gt;Okami HD&lt;/i&gt; is a textbook remaster of a true PS2 era gem.&lt;br&gt;
