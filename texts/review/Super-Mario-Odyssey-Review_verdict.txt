20 years ago we got the genre-defining &lt;i&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/i&gt;, and you can definitely feel that heritage here in &lt;i&gt;Super Mario Odyssey&lt;/i&gt;. There are elements of all his other games here too, but Nintendo has tweaked, added and innovated to make &lt;i&gt;Odyssey&lt;/i&gt; its own beast - and what a beast it is. Gameplay is fun and engaging, the world is an absolute treat to be in and most importantly, I feel happy playing it. When we look back in another 20 years, there is no doubt that this will stand out as an all-time great.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Review copy supplied by Nintendo Australia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
