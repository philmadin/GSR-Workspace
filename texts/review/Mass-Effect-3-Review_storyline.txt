Six months after the <i>Arrival </i>DLC from <i>Mass Effect 2</i>, Shepard is being held in an Alliance building under guard. The Reapers, returned from Dark Space, land on Earth, with Shepard only narrowly escaping back on the Normandy.&nbsp;<p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The game spreads Shepard thin across the galaxy in a desperate attempt to find some way to defeat the Reapers once and for all.The most emotional experience of the three games, <i>Mass Effect 3</i> takes everything you worked so hard to create and crushes it with ease.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Characters you’ve come to love are lost, planets you only heard of are now ruins to the Reapers and the entire galaxy needs Shepard for every single damn problem.Unlike the first and second games where time isn’t necessarily of the essence, in the Reaper War, it&nbsp;is.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>There’s a motive to keep moving with the story and bring the war to a close, rarely leaving time for side missions that don’t in some way impact the main narrative.Bringing a series to an end is not such a simple procedure and whilst it may suffer from some muddied waters towards the end, the entire experience that is being drawn to a close far outweighs the flaws.</p>
