I can't express how incredible this game is, regardless of its flaws. HITMAN will be a patient series this year, but definitely a rewarding experience for players who wait. If you're not a Hitman fan, I'd throw all of your past experiences out the window - this is where you should start, as this is truly a game to muster.
