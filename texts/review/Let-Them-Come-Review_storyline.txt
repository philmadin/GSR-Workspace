The story is rather simple, you are Rock Gunner, a hard-witted gun for hire and all around manly man capable of crushing a beer can by snarling at it. You find yourself trapped on a spaceship with no other survivors and wave after wave of alien scum who&amp;nbsp;are intent on turning your head into their new nacho dip bowl.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The story unfolds over five chapters each, with more challenges than the last. Other than that, it doesn&#039;t have much more storyline to it other than there are aliens which you must either kill or be killed by.&lt;br&gt;
