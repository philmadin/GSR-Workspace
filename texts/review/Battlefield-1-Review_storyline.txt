The story available in <i>Battlefield 1</i> is unconventional when compared to previous <i>Battlefield</i> entries. There is no single protagonist and no one specific stage of the war. <br><br>Instead <i>Battlefield 1</i> opts to let players choose from a series of 'War Stories' or what are generally referred to as chapters in traditional FPS campaigns (this isn't a traditional FPS campaign). <br><br>This approach allows you to see the war through the perspectives of people from different nationalities, genders and ethnicity. The war stories also don't have to be played in order. <br><br>If you wish to skip straight to the Gallipoli chapter then go right ahead. Also how cool is it that such a pivotal moment in Australian history gets shown on such a grand scale such as a <i>Battlefield</i> release?<br><br><p>This ability to jump from vastly different areas such as Arabia to Gallipoli to France would not have been possible if <i>Battlefield 1</i> stuck to the formula we've come to expect from the franchise. <br></p><p><br></p><p>This campaign is by no means groundbreaking, or the best campaign of the year, but it is certainly good from a <i>Battlefield</i> standpoint which is all that really matters here. It is a short but fun experience that should give you roughly 5-6 hours of story driven WW1 violence.&nbsp;</p>
