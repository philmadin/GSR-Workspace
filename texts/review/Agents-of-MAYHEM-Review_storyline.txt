&lt;i&gt;Agents of MAYHEM&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;follows MAYHEM and its agents as they battle the &lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;eague of &lt;b&gt;E&lt;/b&gt;vil &lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt;entlemen&lt;b&gt; I&lt;/b&gt;ntent on &lt;b&gt;O&lt;/b&gt;bliterating &lt;b&gt;N&lt;/b&gt;ations, or L.E.G.I.O.N (this game loves its acronyms).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set after the events of &lt;i&gt;Gat out of Hell&#039;&lt;/i&gt;s &quot;Recreate Earth&quot; ending, the Earth is back to how it was before &lt;i&gt;Saints Row 4&lt;/i&gt;, minus the the Third Street Saints. LEGION has set its sights on obliterating Seoul, South Korea, so MAYHEM has sent its finest (or rather most eccentric) agents to put a stop to their explosive plans.&lt;br&gt;
