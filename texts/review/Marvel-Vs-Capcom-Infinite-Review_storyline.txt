Capcom has decided to take a different approach in writing, with a strong focus&amp;nbsp;on character progression and backstories, governed by understandable (yet mostly ludicrous) comic logic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marvel&#039;s Ultron and Megaman&#039;s Sigma have joined forces and gained control of two of the six Infinity Stones. Joining forces as Ultron Sigma, they have set out to gain the other four Infinity Stones and destroy all organic life. Blocking their path are the heroes of both Marvel and Capcom Universes, who have decided to team up to bring them down by any means necessary. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The story takes players on a surprisingly deep journey into the inner workings of the Marvel and Capcom universe. This game poses an unusual arc for fighting games, resulting in a refreshing change on the generic plot that it feels like every other fighting game opts for. &lt;br&gt;
