&lt;p&gt;The gameplay is the most disappointing element of the game. Lacking basic combat mechanics, such as rolling, manual in-cover options and vehicle manoeuvrability comparatively worse to that of Grand Theft Auto III. Yep, this game feels unfinished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Players start out customising their main character - the leader of Operation Kingslayer. It&#039;s not as in-depth as that of &lt;i&gt;Skyrim&lt;/i&gt;, but it&#039;s worth mentioning as a positive. The highlights for noteworthy content are few and none are game-changing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of bullets hitting enemies is most satisfying. A new feature called a Drone, which can mark enemies in the air is an incredible covert option in this game. The character levelling and skills system isn&#039;t addictive, but it&#039;s not bad either. The map is a mammoth, with repetitive encounters and situations throughout. Weapon customisation is probably the major highlight of the game, with hundreds of weapon mods to unlock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, let&#039;s touch on some of the other non-irritating features (you&#039;re right, that was sarcasm): Let&#039;s talk about the ghosts. They spawn randomly near the player if they&#039;re too far away. They float on water when they die. They can shoot through solid structures, and at impossible distances/weather conditions. They are either too far away to support the player or too close and ineffective - leaving the player to die. They don&#039;t understand the concept of &#039;Regroup&#039;. You could almost say that the functionality of this unit is broken (tested on all four AI difficulties).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animals - great to see, but you can&#039;t interact with them. Yes, you go straight through them, no cow-tipping in this one. Let&#039;s talk about auto-driving, wait, there is none. The player has options to sit in the passenger seats, but no crew member (NPC) can drive the vehicle. The passenger seat feature is only useful in multiplayer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Players can disrupt a group of enemies, inducing suspicion, however you&#039;ll find one enemy still talking to the air, as though the enemies that are searching for the player are still present.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The side and story missions are not only repetitive, but they&#039;re predictable. After players kill one of the 26 bosses, the process of luring or investigating the other bosses is rinse and repeat. This doesn&#039;t stimulate investment into the storyline (except for mission audio correspondence), merely run in, kill, next.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In multiplayer, teams that matchmake have no obligation to stay as a group. Any player of the team can wander off and do their own thing. Teamwork is not forced; therefore, it seems like it&#039;s not encouraged.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
