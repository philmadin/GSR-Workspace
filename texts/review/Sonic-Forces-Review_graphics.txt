This game looks fine, nothing to write home about, it gets the job it sets out to do done. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All the characters look like they would be better suited to a Saturday morning cartoon, but that&#039;s not necessarily a bad thing. The art style gives off its own feel and the world is very vibrant and looks quite detailed, if you weren&#039;t speeding on past, I&#039;m sure it would be packed with easter eggs for the hardcore fans to search out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other than all that, I must say that I really enjoyed how the game does a throwback to when Sonic was king of the consoles, with several classic side scrolling Sonic levels which would make even the biggest scorned fans a little giddy.&lt;br&gt;
