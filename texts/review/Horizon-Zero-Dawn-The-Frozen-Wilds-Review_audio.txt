I feel like a broken record for saying this, but the impeccable soundtrack, expertly delivered voice acting, and immersive combat sounds have been carried over from the base game. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But instead of being a boring reproduction, The Frozen Wilds puts it&#039;s out spin on all of these elements to create top-notch audio across all aspects of the game, which really goes a long way in making the player feel comfortable yet curious about what is yet to come.&lt;br&gt;
