Exiles is a solid looking game, with some great creature designs. The visuals, particularly in the forested areas along the river, can be stunning at times, and the higher you climb, the more incredible the view.&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game has a great sense of scale, from fields dotted with gazelle and rhino to the towering avatars, it&#039;s a game in which I often find myself admiring the landscape. There are a few rough edges here and there, and a plethora of odd but easily ignored bugs, but overall it&#039;s a winner.&lt;/p&gt;
