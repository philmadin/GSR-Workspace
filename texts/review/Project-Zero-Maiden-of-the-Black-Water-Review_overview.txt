Project Zero: Maiden of the Black Water (otherwise known as Fatal Frame V) is the latest instalment in Koei Tecmoâ€™s long running horror series. Exclusive to the Wii U, this game eschews the action tropes of modern horror games, and embraces the slow-burning fear of the great spine-tinglers of yore.
