The music is the biggest letdown. For everything that &lt;i&gt;Agents of MAYHEM&lt;/i&gt; does right, the music brings all that crashing down. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is no music that either engages or motivates the player. Instead &lt;i&gt;Agents of MAYHEM&lt;/i&gt; has a generic superhero soundtrack that is as boring as &lt;i&gt;Superman Returns&lt;/i&gt; when roaming around the small sandbox. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Things don&#039;t get any better when you enter your agency provided car; all there is to listen to is what sounds like a copyright free electronic soundtrack which makes your fun car ride as annoying as possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is such a shame coming from the developer of the &lt;i&gt;Saints Row &lt;/i&gt;series, which featured a mix of genres along with new and classic hits to fill your car rides through the sprawling sandbox.&lt;br&gt;
