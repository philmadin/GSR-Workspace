Dragon Ball Fusions sports some of the most impressive visuals of any game on the 3DS system. The worlds and character models are consistent and shine in their surroundings, with pop-ins and blurry images very few and far between.&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worlds your character traverses look like they&#039;re lifted straight from the anime series, and are a delight to explore. The various special attacks your characters perform are also very consistent with the source material, delivering an overall solid graphical package.&lt;/p&gt;
