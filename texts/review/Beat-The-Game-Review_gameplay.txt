Playing this game is fun mostly because you have no clue about what to expect from interacting with its world, wherever interaction is possible. The gameplay is quite linear and very short. It is a bit disappointing that the game had to end so quickly, because I had so much fun being in that universe that was obviously inspired by surrealist art, possibly of &lt;i&gt;Salvador Dali&lt;/i&gt;&#039;s works specifically. Even though the ultimate aim of the game is to create music from sounds you record, the visual art aspect of the game steals the spotlight every single time. The music-making part of the game is not something that hasn&#039;t been attempted before in a game. So, it was not as exciting. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was still fun to play around with the mixer to create music so that sand surfing giants and the polygon people would enjoy our music. Having pointed that out, there are still a few shortcomings that I would like to see improved or corrected. For example, there is not much to do in the game except playing with the recorder and mixer. Even that has its limitations. The stretch of the game world is too small for its potential. But then again, since it is a non-open world indie game, maybe I shouldn&#039;t have such expectations.
