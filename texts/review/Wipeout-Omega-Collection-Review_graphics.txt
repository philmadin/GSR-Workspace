If you&#039;ve never played a &lt;i&gt;WipEout&lt;/i&gt; game before you probably wouldn&#039;t believe someone if they told you that these games came out on the PS3 and PS Vita. They look as crisp as any arcade racer currently on the market.&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s clear that the developers of this game had a strong affinity for the originals and their hard work has shown in spades here.&lt;/p&gt;
