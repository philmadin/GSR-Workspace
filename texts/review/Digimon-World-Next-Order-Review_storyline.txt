The story begins with you getting sucked into the digital world where you encounter your two Digimon friends. After a brief tutorial and battle, you are taken to another place in the digital world. There it is explained that the world is in trouble and you must help to restore order.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The story itself is boring. I found it hard to relate to the main character as the story was delivered awkwardly in terms of the translation. The Digimon, I felt, had more personality and impact on the story than anything else.&lt;br&gt;
