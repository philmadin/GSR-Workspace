The combat in &lt;i&gt;Andromeda&lt;/i&gt; is simply the best iteration in any of the games so far. Fighting is surprisingly fluid and levelling up now allows more versatility in regards to the allocation of skill points.&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are no longer locked down into simply being a soldier, a biotic or an engineer. You can mix and match as much as you want providing a much richer gameplay experience. Both single player and multiplayer provide laudable improvements to movement, gunplay and special abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
