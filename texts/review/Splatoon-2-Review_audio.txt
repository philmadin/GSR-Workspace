Sound too is unlike anything I&#039;ve heard in a game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The soundtrack is so strange and different, I simply cannot praise the composers enough. With odd, garbled vocals and unusual usage of syth instruments, Nintendo have &lt;i&gt;absolutely&lt;/i&gt; outdone themselves in this area. Even small things, like plopping into an ink puddle from a great hight, is super satisfying on the ears!&lt;br&gt;
