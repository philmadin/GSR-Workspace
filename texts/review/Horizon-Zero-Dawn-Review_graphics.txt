One of the most gorgeous games so far this year. Some areas exist alone just for photo opportunities. The lighting and the weather effects are almost perfect. Although, the characters can look unrealistic and rigid due to the sometimes plastic look of their models. Then in other moments, the amount of detail captured is amazing. The environments show detail and variety that rarely felt repeated.&lt;br&gt;
