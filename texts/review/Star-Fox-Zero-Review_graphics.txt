Don't let the screen shots fool you. Though models and textures are very simple, Star Fox Zero is actually quite a gorgeous game, thanks to its huge object count and 60 fps action. The fact that it does this on two screens simultaneously is a real testament to the programmers' talents. Slowdown does occur on occasion, but it isn't too invasive.
