Yakuza Kiwamis&#039; gameplay can only be explained as amazingly fun. It felt like the first hour or so of Yakuza Kiwami was cutscene after cutscene, but once the game stopped smacking the player in the face with exposition, Yakuza Kiwami is seriously fun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yakuza Kiwami consists of four basic fighting styles to choose from which are: Rush (which is the easiest), Beast (which is slower than The Hulk in knee-high mud), Brawler (which pretty much makes you an MMA Fighter), and Dragon (which would be the best, if you didn&#039;t have to spend the whole game fighting another character to unlock everything). All of these styles offer you a different way to battle your foes and clean up the streets of Kamurocho. &lt;br&gt;
