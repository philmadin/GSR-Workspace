The cute, animation style graphics in &lt;i&gt;Tethered&lt;/i&gt; are phenomenal. Graphics are extremely polished and well thought out, really lending to the immersion in game. I find that the art style really suits the game, and while night time brings out enemies, it doesn&#039;t feel &#039;scary&#039;. This means that the game can be suitable for kids and adults alike, overall really making the game feel playable and enjoyable if you&#039;re looking for something fun to play.&amp;nbsp;
