A majority of sound lies in the ambience of the world at large. Minimalism helps create a sense of isolation, but also peace. Instead of spooky music and the pitter patter of tiny creatures in the night, you will hear the cold wind during the winter months, or the birds and insects of the warmer half of the year. The folky tunes that overlay the experience are fitting and catchy, complimenting the experience.
