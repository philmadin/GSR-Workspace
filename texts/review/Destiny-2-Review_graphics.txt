Bungie has done well to create many uniquely detailed environments. Each planet is different from the last. It is a large improvement from the original &lt;i&gt;Destiny&lt;/i&gt; in both quality and art direction. The cut scenes are gorgeous and will look even better once it is released on PC.&lt;br&gt;
