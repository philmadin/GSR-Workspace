This is an adventure game that really challenges you with environmental puzzles without ever making them feel cheap. The game doesn't want to stump you, it wants you to see this journey through until the conclusion. There was only one puzzle throughout the entire game that admittedly frustrated me, but after I figured it out I felt extremely satisfied. All I'll say is damn that Hook! This experience of mine kind of perfectly encapsulates just what <i>Inside</i> is about, it rewards you for completing puzzles while still remaining challenging enough to mentally stimulate you.Â
