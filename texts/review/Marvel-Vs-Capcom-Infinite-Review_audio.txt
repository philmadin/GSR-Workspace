This is where &lt;i&gt;Marvel Vs. Capcom: Infinite&lt;/i&gt; makes the same mistake as other fighting games: with generic and uninspiring music adding nothing to the atmosphere that the game is going for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other than that inevitable let down, the character dialogue is spot on with each character given time to flesh out their involvement in the story, and inject some humour into the tense and sometimes boring parts of the narrative.&lt;br&gt;
