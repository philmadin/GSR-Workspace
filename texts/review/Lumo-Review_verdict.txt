&lt;p&gt;Many of us look back at gaming from our childhoods with great fondness, and I&#039;m sure many of you still have an old console or emulator for those trips down memory lane. Playing those old games is a blast because we remember them for what they are - &lt;i&gt;Lumo &lt;/i&gt;tries to take those memories and put them into an anthology of happiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lumo &lt;/i&gt;is targeted at a very specific audience, and if you recognise any of the references in this review, it&#039;s worth a look. As a reminder of what was, it succeeds well. But in today&#039;s day and age, a game needs to be more than just happy memories.&lt;/p&gt;
