The audio for <i>Ratchet & Clank</i> is very polished. Each planet has its own soundtrack and is overlaid with explosions, vehicles flying overhead and various other noises. It is sensory overload. Voice acting is up to par with major animation films. Jim Ward carries the game as Captain Qwark. His smug and sarcastic attitude is a highlight amongst the other great voice overs provided.
