Hey there,<br />
<br />
Courtroom is one word.<br />
<br />
Cases like you've mentioned are referred to 'cold case(s)' in real life.<br />
<br />
Instead of "dated", use 'outdated'. <br />
<br />
"No matter youâ€™re opinion", please recognise the difference between 'your' and 'you're'. You basically said: "No matter you are opinion".<br />
<br />
"This first entry will stay with you for a long time" - never use definite sentences. In this case, you used "will". Not all people will agree with this, hence use the word 'may'.
