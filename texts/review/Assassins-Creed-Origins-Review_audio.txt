It&#039;s one thing to create a decent soundtrack for a game. It&#039;s another to create one that suits the historical setting and create then consistently use an iconic motif. The music perfectly blends the &lt;i&gt;Assassin&#039;s Creed Origins&lt;/i&gt; motifs and themes with an Egyptian sound that perfectly suits each scenario. The atmosphere in tombs is great as well. But being a Ubisoft game, voice acting is its downfall.
