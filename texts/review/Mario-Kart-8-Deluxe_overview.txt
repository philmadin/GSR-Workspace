Originally released for the Wii U in 2014, &lt;i&gt;Mario Kart 8&lt;/i&gt; was a worthy continuation of Nintendo&#039;s legendary franchise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Selling 8 million units, it became the system&#039;s highest-selling title; so it&#039;s no surprise that Nintendo has seen fit to re-release it for their new console - the Switch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now enhanced with all original DLC and more content, there has never been a better time to take this game for a spin!&lt;br&gt;
