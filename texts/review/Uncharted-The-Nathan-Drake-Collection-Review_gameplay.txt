The Uncharted series is a third person, action-adventure game that also contains some 3D platforming and puzzle solving. Gameplay focuses on cover-based shooting with new weapons obtained from downed enemies.<br />

Bluepoint Games has unified the controls from all three games. The stealth mechanics are still painful despite their attempts to fix it. Sometimes, Drake will hide behind the wrong spot or wont break cover at all, resulting in unnecessary deaths. Melee combat is lacking but improves with each game. The vehicle sections are challenging due to their clunkiness rather than the difficulty itself. Puzzles are often basic and most are resolved with the the use of Drake's journal or hinted at by the characters.<br />

Impressive action segments, such as the cruise ship, flips the game on its head. By changing perspectives with skewed camera angles and added pressure from enemies, it forces the player to quickly adapt to the situation at hand. The Uncharted series still holds up well despite its age.
