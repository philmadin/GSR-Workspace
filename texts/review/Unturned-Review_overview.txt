In 2014, a game by the name of Unturned appeared on Steam. Following in the footsteps of the wildly successful DayZ, it entered early access with the same goal as its inspiration: to create a persistent online multiplayer world in which players would have to survive against the elements, against the hordes of undead and against each other. But unlike DayZ and so many more of these survival games, Unturned has left early access.
