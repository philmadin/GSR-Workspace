Aloy finds herself in a strange snow-capped land, far north from home, after hearing whispers and stories of a distant tribe under siege in their own land by the creatures they were once akin to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set after the events of the base game, The Frozen Wilds does a great job at expanding on what made the base game so interesting (aside from the robot dinosaurs). This DLC provides more content-rich lore and intrigue for players to explore at their own leisure, as well as a plethora of quality side quests for the player to run away and experience the kooky and funny characters, which add much-needed information that the serious main story hides away. &lt;br&gt;
