<p><font face="Georgia, serif"><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">By the time you get up to playing <i style="font-size: 13.3333px;">Trials &amp; Tribulations</i> you have a pretty clear idea of what to expect when it comes to an Ace Attorney game. This game is no different. For the most part, you play as Phoenix Wright, a 26-year-old defence attorney who works at the Wright &amp; Co Law Offices. This time round he faces his biggest challenges yet thanks to a set of murders that are all connected via one person and a mask-wearing, coffee-loving, prosecutor who has it out for him.&nbsp;</span></font></p><p><font color="#505050" face="Georgia, serif"><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;"><br></span></font></p><p><font color="#505050" face="Georgia, serif"><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;"><br></span></font></p><p><font face="Georgia, serif"><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">This game certainly changes things up a bit, compared to the first two. The first case has you playing as Phoenix’s mentor, Mia Fey, which is the first time you’re playing as someone other than Phoenix. In the second case, you’re required to defend a man not from murder this time, but theft. These two things provide a nice change of pace from the usual formula of an Ace Attorney game and both cases have an interesting premise and another set of crazy characters.&nbsp;</span></font></p><p><font color="#505050" face="Georgia, serif"><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;"><br></span></font></p><p><font color="#505050" face="Georgia, serif"><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;"><br></span></font></p><p><font face="Georgia, serif"><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">The third case, <i style="font-size: 13.3333px;">Recipe for Turnabout</i>, starts off far differently than any other case in the series so far. You’re first greeted with a cutscene that shows Phoenix losing a trial. After this, a month has passed and it’s Phoenix’s job to uncover the truth of that trial and overturn the ‘Guilty’ verdict for the defendant.</span></font></p><p><font color="#505050" face="Georgia, serif"><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;"><br></span></font></p><p><font color="#505050" face="Georgia, serif"><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;"><br></span></font></p><p><font face="Georgia, serif"><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">The fifth case in the game is easily the best and is widely regarded by fans to be the best in the series. It features a murder that takes place at a temple, called Hazakura Temple. After Phoenix falls into a raging river, it’s up to Miles Edgeworth to defend an acolyte that’s been accused of murder. With a slew of returning characters and a murderous plot involving the dead, this case provides an exciting end to a fantastic trilogy.</span></font></p><p><br></p>
