Of course, strategy games are all about the, well, strategy, and you won&#039;t find much better. While the gameplay remains unchanged since 1998, Zealots are stupidly powerful, Hydralisks will decimate light forces and Siege Tanks can hold down huge areas with ease, there&#039;s a number of issues that should have been addressed.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of units you can control at any given time is locked to 12, making long engagements more arduous than need be. There are a number of quality of life things ranging from how rally points work through to the way units move. While I understand that Blizzard wanted to preserve the original experience, having the ability to switch between what is little more than a graphical update to a 19-year-old game and a truly modernised version of that game would have been nice. As it stands, if you enjoy the gameplay of &lt;i&gt;Brood War&lt;/i&gt; you&#039;ll enjoy this, but I cannot recommend it for those more used to modern strategy titles.&lt;/p&gt;
