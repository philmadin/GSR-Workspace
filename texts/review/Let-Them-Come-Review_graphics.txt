The pixel art style really adds to the quirky 1980&#039;s over-the-top fun feeling that this game shoots for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While some might argue that&lt;i&gt; Let Them Come&lt;/i&gt; is an ugly game. I would recommend that those people play this game, and are able to see that this art style is a deliberate throwback to the old style of arcade shoot &#039;em ups (which to be honest are still great fun to play right now).&lt;br&gt;
