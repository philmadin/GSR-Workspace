The sounds of &lt;i&gt;Beat The Game&lt;/i&gt; are also something to be worth mentioning. If I have not given it much credit, it is only because it is often overshadowed by the visuals of the game. It does not mean that the music and sound effects of the game are not matching up to its visual counterpart. The visuals are just what drives the player to look for new sounds in the game.&amp;nbsp;
