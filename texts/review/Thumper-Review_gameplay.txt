<i><br>Thumper </i>is deceptively simple at first glance but soon becomes devilishly challenging. It plays very much like <i>Guitar Hero</i>, tapping the right keys as they appear in the right spot; however it's far more in-depth than it appears.<br><br><br>Smashing the buttons with the correct timing to pass a level or defeat a boss; looking to see what challenges lie ahead; growing ever more aware of the increasing speed and then it hits you -Â <i>Thumper </i>isn't messing around.<br><br><br>To sum it up in one word, <i>Thumper </i>is brutal, unforgiving even. Most of the time this works in its favour, the challenge is fair, gameplay fun, but, and it's a big but, there's nothing else. No rewards or upgrades, no level editor or personal music importing. Outside of getting better scores and perfect runs, there's nothing to bring a player back, not even anything to keep them playing outside of wanting to finish the game.<br><br><br>Ultimately, <i>Thumper </i>controls well and feels great but it has a very short life span, especially for the $20-USD price point.<br>
