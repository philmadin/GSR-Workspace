<br><i>Dragon Quest VII</i> is seemingly endless in its content.<br><br><br>That 100 hours I mentioned for the plot? Now you can add another 100 for its absolute wealth of side-content.<br><br><br>A JRPG, the game is expectedly unwelcoming for more impatient players. Make no mistake, this is one for patient, old school adventurers. Its turn-based combat system - albeit incredibly refined - is unambitious in its execution, though ArtePiazza have made some welcome improvements, like being able to see enemies in the field (negating the random aspect), and speeding-up level acquisitions, which thankfully pares back grinding. I also greatly appreciated the tablet radar, which has made story progression that little bit less confusing.<br><br><br>The big 'thing' for combat in this entry is its job system. With 20 jobs available, there is a huge amount of customisation for your squad; and these can be mixed and matched to further create your ultimate crew. Standard jobs like warrior, priest and thief exist alongside more unconventional styles like shepperd, monster masher and jester. I really enjoyed experimenting with these different classes, especially considering Square-Enix have gone to great pains to make each one useful, unlike the original PS version, where gamers only really needed the four basic ones.<br><br><br>That's not all; monster recruiting is another huge part of the package. Like <i>Dragon Quest Monsters</i> or <i>Pokemon</i>, and this brings with it a <i>further</i> 34 jobs to choose from! There are a astonishing 457 creatures to claim and train, and these can help you in combat, as well as being sent (as a party of three) through the internet, in order to find Traveler's Tablets. <br><br><br>These tablets are tied to The Haven, a home for your crew of monsters, which initially starts as a bare strip of land. As more of them move in, you will eventually unlock the casino (a series staple), as well as the ability to share the Traveler's Tablets via SpotPass. These let you create randomly-generated dungeons that are filled with rare monsters and items, and sending these to the online community nets you three in return. The properties of these dungeons depends on the types of monsters you send as scouts; for example, if you send three metal enemies, then other players will experience a metal-themed dungeon!<br><br><br>Don't let the game's cute exterior fool you; this is an absolutely gargantuan package. I really don't know how they fit it all in such a tiny 3DS cart. It's a good thing that this is a portable game, as it made it easier for me to clock in the hours, even if it was just an hour or two before bed.<br>
