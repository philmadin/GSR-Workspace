I don&#039;t think Blizzard has ever had trouble creating great audio. From each races&#039; themes through the various unit and building effects, &lt;i&gt;StarCraft Remastered &lt;/i&gt;sounds great. They&#039;ve redone much of the old music and while some aren&#039;t fans of the new stuff, I find myself grooving along with it constantly.
