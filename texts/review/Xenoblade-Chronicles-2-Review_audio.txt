Audio is improved dramatically from &lt;i&gt;Xenoblade Chronicles X&lt;/i&gt;, which goes back to the sweeping fantasy scores of the Wii game, and not the obnoxious rapping of the Wii U one. I&#039;ve found myself continuously humming the tear-jerking main theme of, the high energy of Mor Ardain, or the blood-pumping adventure of Gormott.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Performances too are much better, perhaps owing to the translation of Nintendo of Europe (rather than Nintendo of America for &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;). Characters cover a wide array of accents, from the Geordie slang of Rex, to Welsh, Scottish, Irish, American, and even Australian. Of course, being a Japanese game, lip-synching is often hilariously out of tune, but the energetic prose of the voice actors more than makes up for it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some of it can grate though. Battle speech is incredibly repetitive (but can be turned off), and a lot of the comedy scenes had me cringing (though Zeke is my man). &lt;br&gt;
