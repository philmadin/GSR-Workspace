Rugby League Live 4 features a career mode similar to other instalments in the series, where you take your rookie from the Holden Cup under 20&#039;s league to the top of either the NRL or the British Super League.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The career mode in Rugby League Live 4 is standard for the sports game genre, in how you progress your chosen career of Rookie, Star, or Coach at your favourite team from a lower ranked player to the top player in all of rugby league.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The thing that sets Rugby League Live 4&#039;s career apart from other sports games is that choosing to play as a rookie means starting as an 18-year-old in the minor leagues. You build yourself up by playing games and winning championships until you are the best player in your position, then retire to a desk job calling the action while younger players try to break your records. (That last part was a joke, Rugby League Live 4 is not that meta.)&lt;br&gt;
