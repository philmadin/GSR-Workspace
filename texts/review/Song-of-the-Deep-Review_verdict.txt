<i>Song of the Deep</i> is a laid back, if at times dull game that will be ideal for young children or anyone desiring solid underwater gameplay. The lack of variety given the Irish mythos is a missed opportunity and could have led to some much more heart pounding or challenging moments for Merryn.<p><br></p><p>Thus, if your intent is to fight some underwater Leviathans, then youâ€™re looking in the wrong place. However anyone seeking a relaxing game to kill a few hours would definitely enjoy <i>Song of the Deep</i>.</p>
