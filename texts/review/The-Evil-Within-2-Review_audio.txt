&lt;p&gt;Not only does this game have music that makes the player paranoid around every knock and bang, but it also builds expertly through each level and really creates an atmosphere of fear and terror. The voice acting in &lt;i&gt;The Evil Within 2&lt;/i&gt; is some of the best you will find in the Survival Horror genre.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
