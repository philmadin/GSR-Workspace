&lt;i&gt;Evil Genome&lt;/i&gt; isn&#039;t a bad game, though it isn&#039;t even a good game. Simply put it is a mediocre game. The gameplay and art are solid enough, but the story is boring, the dialogue and music are uninspiring, and don&#039;t add anything to the game whatsoever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best summed up,&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Evil Genome&lt;/i&gt; is a game of little give and a whole heap of take. &lt;br&gt;
