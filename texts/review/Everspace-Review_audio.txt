The soundtrack rises and falls with what happens on screen, providing great ambience when exploring, and creating tension when dogfighting. Effects are punchy and layered well, prioritising critical warnings and alarms over all the chaos that can be going on around you. The voice acting also warrants a mention, as it is well above standard.
