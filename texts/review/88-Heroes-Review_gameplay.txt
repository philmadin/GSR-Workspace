&lt;p&gt;Just in case you haven&#039;t seen enough eights yet, here&#039;s the premise: you have 88 seconds to complete each of the 88 levels. Spread over four worlds, each level starts with one of 98 wildly different characters (thanks to the included DLC). Die, and you lose the ability to play with that hero again, starting the level over with someone new.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&#039;s Nibbles the Destroyer, a hamster that steamrolls through any enemy it finds. El Delayo, who as the name suggests isn&#039;t the quickest at reacting to your input. Retro Reptile plays like the famous Snake of old, Low Res Reggie clearly hasn&#039;t been updated to modern looks and physics, and Claire Voyant can win or lose the level with the flip of a coin. One of my favourites heroes is What, who imitates the wonderfully irritating paperclip from &#039;97 Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Controls are simple: move, jump and use ability if available. Each hero responds differently to these inputs, and this is where the entertainment value is found. &lt;i&gt;88 Heroes&lt;/i&gt; is a proper old-school platformer, with success depending on timing more than anything else. The levels themselves are quite generic and really don&#039;t vary too much, so to have a hook based on how the hero plays is actually quite neat. Expect to die a lot as you come to grips with each hero&#039;s playstyle, but when you do get a handle on them the platforming itself is a real treat. Sharp, tight and (with the exception of El Delayo), responsive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few extra modes thrown in to mix things up, but I do want to mention that &#039;Game Over&#039; is defined by time, not hero count. If you lose all of your heroes, you can continue on with your last hero until the timer runs out. Cheap much?&lt;/p&gt;
