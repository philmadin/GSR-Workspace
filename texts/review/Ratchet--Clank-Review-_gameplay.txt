Spanning multiple planets, <i>Ratchet & Clank </i>offers many interesting ways of keeping the game fresh to the very end. From hoverboard racing to puzzles and flying segments, there is always a challenge to overcome.  The game progressively increases in difficulty to the point where the weapon choice can affect the outcome of a fight.<p align="LEFT" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; margin-bottom: 0cm;"></p><p align="LEFT" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; margin-bottom: 0cm;">Insomniac Games</span></i> have brought the original game up to date with gameplay that is both entertaining and varied. They have overhauled mechanics that used to be clunky, like swimming and gadget switching,and made it almost perfect. The controls have also been refined to keep up with Ratchet's movements. Strafing, flipping and jumping around; trouble has never felt this smooth. The camera is able to keep up with the action and is rarely blocked by obstacles. </p><p align="LEFT" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; margin-bottom: 0cm;">Cool weapons are a staple for the series and there is no disappointment here. New additions, like the Pixelizer and Groovitron, allow for more distraction and destruction. Guns upgrade from use and by spending Raritanium, they can be made even more powerful. The upgrades are focused on boosting certain attributes for each weapon like range, ammo, power, etc. As it's a rare resource, choose your upgrades wisely.</p>
