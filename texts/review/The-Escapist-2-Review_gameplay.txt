While the story of &lt;i&gt;The Escapist 2&lt;/i&gt; is rather shallow, the gameplay is the complete opposite. The game gives you an insane amount of freedom. When the player is placed inside a prison, they can literally do anything they want to escape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another great gameplay feature of The Escapist 2 is its perfect use of seamless online multiplayer. Players can join and leave their friends prison without any interruption to the game, and after playing this game for some time with a colleague, I can say with confidence that multiplayer mode is where &lt;i&gt;The Escapist 2&lt;/i&gt; stands out. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;
