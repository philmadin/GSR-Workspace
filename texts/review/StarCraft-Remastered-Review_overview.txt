On March 31, 1998, the gaming world changed forever. &lt;i&gt;StarCraft&lt;/i&gt;, the sci-fi strategy title developed by Blizzard Entertainment landed on shelves and the way things were done would never be the same again. A few months later the acclaimed expansion, &lt;i&gt;Brood War&lt;/i&gt;, was released and gave birth to modern e-sports. Like its insectoid race, the Zerg, &lt;i&gt;StarCraft&lt;/i&gt; infested the world, and now, after almost 20 years, it has returned. For the sake of this review, both &lt;i&gt;StarCraft&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Brood War&lt;/i&gt; will be considered as a single entity within the remastered game.
