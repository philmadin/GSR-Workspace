The sheer beauty and keen detail has been carried over from the first game, giving fans a chance for an in-depth tour through some of the series most breathtaking and iconic environments. Aside from some new maps that look as though they were taken straight from the silver screen, &lt;i&gt;Star Wars: Battlefront 2&lt;/i&gt; doesn&#039;t really add anything to the game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The characters all look magnificent. Even the faces look great and don&#039;t glitch out a la &lt;i&gt;Mass Effect: Andromeda&lt;/i&gt; and the overall graphics of this game are terrific, with very few (if any) graphical glitches, and shows that this is a standout among the field of shooters available today.&lt;br&gt;
