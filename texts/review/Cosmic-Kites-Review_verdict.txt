This is a simple and balanced game, with the music certainly contributing a lot towards final impressions of playing it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Cosmic Kites&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt; is a good example of different elements being brought together in a simple way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&#039;s a lot that could arguably be improved on, but I would still recommend this game to arcade game lovers. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
