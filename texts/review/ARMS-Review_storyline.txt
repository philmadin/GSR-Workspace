Unlike the detailed narratives of other fighters like &lt;a href=&quot;http://gamesharkreviews.com/review.php?t=Injustice_2_Review&amp;amp;g=Injustice_2&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Injustice 2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://gamesharkreviews.com/review.php?t=Tekken_7_Review&amp;amp;g=Tekken_7&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tekken 7&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the plot for &lt;i&gt;ARMS&lt;/i&gt; is very simple.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like the Switch&#039;s own &lt;a href=&quot;http://gamesharkreviews.com/review.php?t=Ultra_Street_Fighter_II%3A_The_Final_Challengers_Review&amp;amp;g=Ultra_Street_Fighter_II%3A_The_Final_Challengers&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ultra Street Fighter II&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, what little story is offered is told through the individual stories of the fighters. Unfortunately, you wont find any detailed exposition or lavish cut-scenes here, but rather a simple Grand Prix mode that comprises of eight fights and two minigames.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Presented like a TV program and hosted by the eponymous &#039;Biff&#039;, what little world-building offered is done via the simple profiles of each fighter, as well as dialogue by Biff himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#039;s serviceable enough, but underwhelming when compared to the competition, or even Nintendo&#039;s own games like &lt;i&gt;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Splatoon&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hopefully a future update will bring a full-fledged campaign mode, because the world and characters Nintendo have created for &lt;i&gt;ARMS&lt;/i&gt; are very appealing indeed!&lt;br&gt;
