<i>Battlefield 1's</i> audio sets a new standard for future DICE productions. It is by far the grittiest of any of the <i>Battlefield</i> games. You can hear the men around you screaming as you take take an objective point or melee an incoming enemy to death. <br><p><br></p><p>The roar of the engines in dated attack planes are just brilliant and every bullet feels powerful as they reverberate throughout the air. The weapons themselves aren't what you would could "historically accurate" but who gives a damn? <br></p><p><br></p><p>This is fast paced competitive shooter action and the weapon firing rates reflect this. Also the brutality of a successful bayonet charge is both terrifying and immensely satisfying. Both the receiver and the aggressor of a bayonet attack can be seen screaming at each other in an act of primal force. <br></p><p><br></p><p>This is a quality example of how the audio makes you feel like you truly are apart of one of the most awful and costly wars in human history.</p><p></p>
