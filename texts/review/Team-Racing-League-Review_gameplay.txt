The players engage in a race around a closed circuit with a top down view. However, unlike other racing games, only one player&amp;nbsp;from a team has to finish. The other racers can choose to assist the teammate by blocking and disrupting enemies or boosting their teammates.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a wide range of ways to approach this game. You can directly assist a teammate by boosting him or use disabling abilities like roadblocks to counter opponents. Each ability can be countered and players need to decide a quick counter play to the opponent&#039;s strategies to take the win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;The gameplay however, has nothing more to it. It lacks depth. Due to the game being in early access, wait times are really long. The game is only fun when playing as a party and just doesn&#039;t have enough modes to keep you engaged. The abilities aren&#039;t intuitive which makes the tutorial a must before going into the game.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
