Sound and music continues the fine, high-quality MGS tradition. Harry Gregson-Williams returns with his movie-aping credentials, and licensed ‘80’s tracks provide some nice contrast to the dramatic pieces form past MGS games (which can also be found in the game). Voice acting is hit-or-miss, with Miller being a particular offender. Kiefer Sutherland does a great job as BB, and Troy Baker is mesmerizing as Ocelot.
