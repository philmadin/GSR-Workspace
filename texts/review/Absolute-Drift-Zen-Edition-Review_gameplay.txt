<p class="MsoNormal">The game shines when you are left to find your own line throughout the open-world, cutting into corners and sliding out of them with precision, culminating in what looks like controlled chaos. <o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p><p class="MsoNormal">The tutorial pushes you into the game fairly quickly, starting from doing a ‘simple’ donut around a large circle to completing a full track. Don’t let the art style fool you, the game make look simple but it is hard to master. You’re rewarded for your patience because once you get the physics of your car, you will be sliding around corners in no time.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p><p class="MsoNormal">You gain more confidence with the car, as you glide around the world, all for it to come crashing down with the next challenge track. This in a way helps the game as it keeps your foot on the pedal, remaining fresh as you learn how to navigate each track for the best drifting line. You’re offered clipping markers to boost your overall score on most corners and drifting lines to slide over for added bonuses which help on your way to mastering a section.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p><p class="MsoNormal">From the challenges to the open world, the gameplay is purely for driving game fans as it doesn’t offer up much depth other than drifting, jumping and knocking down boxes. While the keyboard controls are serviceable be sure to bring a controller along for the drive for better handling and throttle control. <o:p></o:p></p>
