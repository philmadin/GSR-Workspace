In a story that no-one ever saw coming, Bowser has kidnapped Peach and is forcing her to marry him (the shock, the horror!!!). In his efforts to rescue Peach, Mario is defeated by you-know-who and exiled to the kingdom of Bonneton. It is here that Mario meets Cappy - a hat-shaped ghost whose sister Tiara was also kidnapped by Bowser as a headdress for Peach. Mario and Cappy team up to rescue their beloved captives and stop Bowser from having the wedding of his dreams.
