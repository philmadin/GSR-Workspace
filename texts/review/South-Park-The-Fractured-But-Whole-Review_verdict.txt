The only fractured butt you&#039;ll receive is from sitting through the twenty plus hours of ridiculously funny content. Like all comedy, there are hit or miss moments, but what you find funny is already completely subjective. The game itself however, is objectively fun with an addictive combat system, well-paced narrative and well written quips. &lt;i&gt;South Park: The Fractured But Whole &lt;/i&gt;is an amusing experience for both gamers and South Park enthusiasts. Hopefully &#039;The Coons&#039; $100 reward will go towards producing another great South Park game.
