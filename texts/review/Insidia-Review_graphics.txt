It&#039;s like &lt;i&gt;Overwatch&lt;/i&gt;,&amp;nbsp;but in turn-based view. Gotta love the artwork and design aspects of the game. Character design is top-notch. There is a sense of familiarity with the art style that is so inviting to play the game. Apart from the lack of camera rotation and some tooltips, the visual aesthetics of the game is a great experience.
