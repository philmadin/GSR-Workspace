<br>Unlike previous <i>Pokemon</i> games, <i>Pokemon Moon</i> only follows parts of the story formula that is familiar to fans of the series. Your character has moved from Kanto and arrives in Alola with their mother. After an introduction with the region's professor, Professor Kukui, you receive a Pokemon and are told about the island challenge. As a trainer, you must travel to the four islands and face trials before taking on Captains, then the Kahuna. These replace the gym battles from previous games.<br><br><br><br>Sprinkled between your trainer's story, is that of your friends, Lillie and Hau. They often become tedious due to unnecessary dialogue that slows down the flow of the game. It feels like the focus is on them, rather than you and your journey. Team Skull, the new villains, are disappointing and fail to drive the story forward. <br><br><br><br><i>Pokemon Moon</i> seems to lack a special something for you to become invested in the story.<br><br><br>
