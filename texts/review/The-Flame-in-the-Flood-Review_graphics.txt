&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Flame in the Flood&lt;/i&gt; has an interesting style and look, enhancing the character and tone of the game. When Scout is injured or sick, you&#039;ll definitely feel sympathetic just by looking at her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game looks and run smoothly in both tablet and docked mode on the Switch, due partly by the unique visual style of the game.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
