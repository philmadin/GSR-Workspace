&lt;p&gt;One of the outstanding points of the series is the relationships between the different characters. You feel very clearly Ed&#039;s guilt about Al&#039;s situation and how he&#039;s willing to do anything to get his body back, along with how close they are as brothers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roy Mustang&#039;s close relationship with his team is also easy to see. He relies on them heavily for his plans and whenever they&#039;re hurt or in danger, it&#039;s clear to see how much it affects him, especially when it comes to Riza Hawkeye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the original cast of the 2003 anime came back to do &lt;i&gt;Brotherhood&lt;/i&gt; and it&#039;s good to see them come back and to do their familiar roles. Romi Park as Edward is a perfect choice as she puts passion into all the emotional lines making you sympathise with all the hardships he&#039;s been through. Another stand out is Kenta Miyake as Scar, whose powerful voice perfectly portrays Scar&#039;s internal battle of getting vengeance for his people or letting go of his hatred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
