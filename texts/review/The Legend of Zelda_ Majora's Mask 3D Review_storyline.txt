The story begins with young Link traversing the Lost Woods on his trusty steed, Epona. Whilst searching for his beloved ‘friend’ (it’s never specified who), he is accosted by a masked Skull Kid and two fairies, who steal Epona and his precious Ocarina of Time. After making chase (and being turned into a Deku Scrub in the process), Link finds himself in the land of Termina, where he meets the creepy Happy Masked Salesmen. This unnerving chap informs him that Skull Kid stole ‘Majora’s Mask’ – a powerful, evil relic which has caused the moon to plummet toward the earth. In order to save the world, Link must find and stop Skull Kid in three days.
