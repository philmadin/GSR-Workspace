Enemies fling between tedious and frustrating, much like the base game. A lot of what made combat exciting in the former instalments, including <i>Bloodborne</i>, is treading dangerously close to “hard for hard's sake”. <br><br>Many deaths will arise from that one gigantic man with an axe, or the NPC with a black fiery sword flattening you in one swoop. This isn’t new, but combat feels less and less like a back and forth between competitive players and artificial intelligence, but more like a one sided MMA fight with one person picked from the crowd.<br><br>There's a few new tools to make use of however including a total of 16 new weapons and shields, five new armour sets, four new spells and a fancy ring to keep away the cold. <br><br>Miracle users will rejoice at the prospect of having a new way to go on the offensive with the Way of White Corona, a simple disc of light that you can frisbee at enemies for damage once, then again on its return trip.<br><br>The two bosses to conquer are a mixed bag, and are unfortunately at the very end of your play through. The primary boss takes three forms. <br><br>and are ultimately three separate fights that must be restarted should you die. The second is completely optional but, without fighting it there’s not much else to do. <br><br>The lack of boss encounters until the end is part of what drags down the fun. Typically bosses are a possible threat at every turn, the idea that you could walk into a boss fight unprepared and lacking supplies after a heavy fight to reach it, is missing.
