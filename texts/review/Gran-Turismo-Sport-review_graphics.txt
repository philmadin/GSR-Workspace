I don&#039;t think that I&#039;ve ever played a racing game that looks as beautiful as &lt;i&gt;Gran Turismo Sport&lt;/i&gt;. It seems that every game in the series has pushed the limits of whatever console they have been on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gran Turismo Sport&lt;/i&gt; has expertly recreated some of the best real-life racing tracks (such as Australia&#039;s Mount Panorama and Japan&#039;s Tokyo Express Way) complete with all of the smallest details that only the keen-eyed fans would notice.&lt;br&gt;
