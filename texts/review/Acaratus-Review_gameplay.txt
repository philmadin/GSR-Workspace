If you&#039;ve played any other turn based tactics game, you&#039;ve played &lt;i&gt;Acaratus&lt;/i&gt;. It&#039;s pretty standard stuff. Move your units, attack other units, end turn, repeat. It has a few different features like modifying the mechsuits, cards that activate abilities and merchants from which you can purchase components. Ultimately it feels like Nodbrim has taken the parts they liked from other, better games and mashed them together, hoping it would work.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combat isn&#039;t as interesting as &lt;i&gt;X-Com&lt;/i&gt;, the characters aren&#039;t as good as &lt;i&gt;Shadowrun &lt;/i&gt;and it never really feels like its own thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
