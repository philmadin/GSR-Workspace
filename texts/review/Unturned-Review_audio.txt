The audio of Unturned isn&#039;t what I would call great, more so it is serviceable. Zombies grunt and snarl, engines rev, and fires crackle but it all sounds somewhat anaemic, as if the life has been sucked from it. Some sounds, like the gunshots, are very well done but most simply exist. While they&#039;re easily distinguishable, they aren&#039;t anything special.
