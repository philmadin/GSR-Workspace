This is where the game shines. When you hear &#039;turn-based&#039;, you would naturally imagine playing it like a game of chess or even XCOM. But no, it&#039;s not your turn after the opponent&#039;s turn. Every turn is your turn, and also the opponents.&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each turn gives you and your opponent a few seconds to plan an action for one champion. The same champion cannot be controlled in consecutive turns. During the planning phase, both sides decide what to do with a champion. Then comes the action phase where your strategy is unfolded.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It becomes more challenging to predict the outcome of the action phase as the game progresses. Maybe the opponent&#039;s character was planned to move out of the way when you were planning to attack that character, or maybe the opponent planned it wrong such that your attack lands a combo. One wouldn&#039;t know until it all pans out in the action phase. It&#039;s not entirely unpredictable though. Some case are easy to predict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any case, the simultaneous turn system demands a high level of strategy, because the game is not designed in such a way that brute force wins every time. Each character&#039;s strengths and weaknesses can be multiplied depending on how well you coordinate their abilities with the rest of the characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;Apart from character tactics, the game board also assists your team with capture points that can either strengthen your base or damage the &lt;/span&gt;opponent&#039;s base&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;. Utilising each aspect of the game to move your champions towards victory is what the game essentially offers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;Being in its beta state, the game has not much replayability. Therefore, I cannot comment on how this game will turn out when it is fully functional. There are a lot of gaps in the user interface. There is so much information missing that could be vital to understanding the game itself.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
