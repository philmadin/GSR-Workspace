&lt;i&gt;The Girl and The Robot&lt;/i&gt; looks as if it has been torn straight from the pages of a children&#039;s book. It appears almost like water colours, washed out and bright, pale and mystical. Its art style is certainly a unique one, both atmospheric and immersive.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for the visual content, apart from a few sharp angles and the occasional framerate drops, it both looks good and runs well on most machines.&lt;/p&gt;
