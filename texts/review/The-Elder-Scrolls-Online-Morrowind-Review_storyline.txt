&lt;p&gt;Daedric forces reappear causing havoc to the world, and a warrior-poet god is in trouble. His followers are outsourcing ways to help their beloved god, then you rock up, ready for action.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the story elapses, players come across hostile natives with unusual ways of living, a group of assassins that don&#039;t play nice, and much more peculiar things at hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Players commence at the familiar docks of Seyda Neen, and yes, I was salivating with nostalgia. However, don&#039;t expect the same grand entrance of that from the original &lt;i&gt;Morrowind&lt;/i&gt; game back in 2002. This version of &lt;i&gt;Morrowind&lt;/i&gt; is set in a different timeline, and with different developers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After completing the main storyline on two separate accounts, once slow, once fast, I felt that there could have been more passion behind it. I felt no emotional ties to the storyline even though I read every piece of dialogue.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
