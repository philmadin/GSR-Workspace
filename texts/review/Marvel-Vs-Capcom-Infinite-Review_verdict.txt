This is truly a curious game, mostly because this is a fighting game that actually has a story that is intriguing and capable of keeping players interested until the end. The combat is smooth, and the Infinity Stones add another dimension to the core fighting mechanics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The music is nothing new to longtime fans of fighting games, however the visuals are enough to evoke nostalgia for the previous titles, yet still give cause to marvel (pun intended) at the cutting edge graphics that cap off this game.&lt;br&gt;
