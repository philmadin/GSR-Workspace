All up, Aven Colony brings a lot to the table but still feels like there is more stored on the transport ship. The story is unique and fun in that it offers an actual story mode that is more than &quot;here&#039;s a field, build stuff&quot;. The gameplay is what you expect for a city builder, although with a twist of complete freedom mixed in; the map is expansive and full of resources to craft your new home. Aven Colony&#039;s graphics and audio are limited by the type of game that it is, but that is easy to get past once you play the game.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you like games in the city builder genre then Aven Colony is for you. While it&#039;s not the most complete city builder when compared to the old Sim City games, it will keep you entertained for hours with all of its&#039; intergalactic charm, intrigue, and features.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
