The excellent audio from <i>Dawn of War </i>carries over into <i>Winter Assault, </i>with the addition of new characters and units bringing more top notch effects, voice acting and music. The expansion excels in every way the original did with the addition of the glorious themes of the Imperial Guard, a more classic military style that totally fits.
