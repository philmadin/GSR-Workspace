&lt;i&gt;Marvel Vs. Capcom: Infinite&lt;/i&gt; has perfected the tag team combat that has been a staple of the series for years, with a huge array of fighting styles and damage depending on which character you choose. Some attacks are slower than an Incredible Hulk movie, hitting hard and sapping health from their opponents; while others attack with a speedy barrage, capable of draining your foe faster than a toddler with a freemium game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The inclusion of the Infinity Stones, each with their own special powers such as Power, Reality, Space, and Time, make it so that chaining together combinations and supers have never been easier. Overall, combat feels silky smooth and is amazingly user-friendly.&lt;br&gt;
