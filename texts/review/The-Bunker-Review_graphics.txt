<p class="MsoNormal">Not much can be said on the graphical side of <i>The Bunker</i> as it is all live action. Being shot like a film, it clips along at 25 frames a second and I didn’t experience any deviation from this helping with the immersion. The cinematography is also a strong point as it just adds to the overall tone of the game.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">A horror game wouldn’t be half as effective without a great setting and the old, sterile bunker works well to draw the player in. With each level you decline, the darker and grimmer the scenery becomes. Darkness creeps around every corner and the set design makes the facility feel real, leaving you with a tense feeling and sweaty palms. <o:p></o:p></p>
