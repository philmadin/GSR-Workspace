To be honest, I went into &lt;i&gt;Maize&lt;/i&gt; not expecting much from it, but within about an hour I was equally entertained and intrigued about how this story would unfold. The story was bonkers, the dialogue was witty and hilariously funny, and the visuals injected a fun and fresh life into the game. I came out the other side of this game having enjoyed the whole experience. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I recommend that everyone who reads this, pick up a copy of this game and enjoy a genuinely fun game while supporting a creative Indie developer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Review copy supplied by Finish Line Games.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
