The gameplay hasn&#039;t really changed at all in the last two years. It is still centered on delicately written dialogue and walking from place to place. There isn&#039;t much innovation with gameplay but there doesn&#039;t really need to be, the reason we love &lt;i&gt;LIS&lt;/i&gt; is for its conversations and its plot.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The major addition however, is Chloe&#039;s back talk ability. She doesn&#039;t possess the supernatural prowess of time like Max Caulfield, but she does have a quick wit. The game will have segments where Chloe will be able to talk down other characters to achieve what she wants. This plays out in quick time events where she has to select the right insult based on the response she received from the other person. It works well and stays true to the nature of her character.&lt;/p&gt;
