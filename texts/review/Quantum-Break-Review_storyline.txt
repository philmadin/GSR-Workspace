This is the biggest selling point of Quantum Break. You see, this isn't just a videogame per se, but rather, gaming sessions peppered with episodes of a live-action television series.An ambitious multimedia project spearheaded by Microsoft's entertainment division, Remedy's title is a curious beast. In terms of delivery, it is mostly successful; but whether it will actually leave a lasting impression within the medium remains to be seen.&nbsp;<p><br></p><p>&nbsp;First, some plot. Playing as Jack Joyce (acted by Shawn Ashmore), you visit your old stomping grounds of Riverport University, at the urgent quest of your old buddy, Paul Serene (Aiden Gillen). It turns out that Paul has become quite the bigwig, and has discovered the holy grail - time travel. As expected with this narrative trope, things go very wrong, as a paramilitary force invades the campus and steals the invention.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Their name? Monarch Solutions. Their leader? Paul Serene.Shenanigans ensue. A quantum accident causes Jack to gain time-bending powers, and it turns out his deceased brother William (Dominic Monaghan) was the original inventor of the machine, and has left clues regarding future events. Or are they past events? Yes, the story of Quantum Break becomes suitably twisted, as events intertwine with each other. You know that old chestnut â€“ time is an eternal loop. Things happen because they tried to stop it in the first place... that sort of thing.</p>
