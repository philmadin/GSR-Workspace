There is a sense of epic with both the music and sound in&lt;i&gt; Destiny 2&lt;/i&gt;. From the fast and suspenseful to beautiful harmonies, the music is rightfully matched to each environment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The voice acting is great with Nolan North, Bill Nighy, Nathan Fillion and John DiMaggio making the cast come alive. Some of the lines are cheesy but these make the characters memorable.&lt;br&gt;
