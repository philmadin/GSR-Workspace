Ethan Brady is a recent addition to the National Resistance, determined to rid the indomitable United States of its North Korean oppressors. Whilst awaiting contact from a man known as Benjamin Walker, his Cell is uncovered in a raid and taken Prisoner. After breaking free, players rejoin the National Resistance and return to fighting back against their occupiers.&nbsp;<p><br></p><p>The narrative dribbles out over quite a long time, mostly due to the freedom players are given to do their own thing. Like many other games before it however, having a story that is broken up over large chunks of time, especially when there is a sense of urgency, is taxing. Any momentum gained can be lost just as fast when someone decides to go exploring instead of jumping straight into the next mission.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>It’s also a bit bland. There’s a great deal of creativity in video gaming currently and with such a deep topic to cover in North Korea, it feels like wasted opportunity. Lots of explosions and gunfights, characters that would bring police to a party. But no one to latch on to, a main character that merely acts as our vessel, and a lack of desire to see it through to the end.</p>
