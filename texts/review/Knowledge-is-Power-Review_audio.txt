If you like going to trivia nights, hearing the delivery of the questions and the fun of hearing the ding of a correct answer, then you will love the audio of&lt;i&gt; Knowledge is Power&lt;/i&gt;. From the clear delivery of the questions to all the kooky sounds of the game,&lt;i&gt; Knowledge is Power&lt;/i&gt; really gives off a fun and quirky feeling that hasn&#039;t been seen since the &lt;i&gt;BUZZ&lt;/i&gt; games of the PS2 era.&lt;br&gt;
