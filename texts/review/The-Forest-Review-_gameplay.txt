&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Forest&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;has&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt; full controller support, which I personally love as a selling point for PC users.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;As for gameplay in its entirety, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Forest &lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;can feel slightly &#039;clunky&#039; in some regards, but the development team is consistently fixing and upgrading the mechanics, which is a bonus for long time players.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Players may have issues when accessing multiplayer mode, as some people do hack in-game, and currently, there is no solution to this.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;Playing through the game is generally a breeze, but the odd glitch can be encountered here and there, but throughout my travels, I haven&#039;t encountered anything game-breaking.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;I find the best part of the game to be the building system, which allows players to select different builds, such as houses, walls, defences, fires and much more through a &#039;survival book&#039; which your character has from the start of the game.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The building system is a simple process, where players select what they want to build, then go off and harvest the required items, which then either are placed in your inventory, or in the case of logs, need to be carried back to your build site.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;I find this a great feature, but the crafting and inventory mat can sometimes feel over-crowded in late-game&lt;/span&gt;play &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;and has been known to glitch occasionally.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest flaw by far with the crafting system is the lack of very non- existent direction.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;If you don&#039;t know how to craft it, or if no one tells you how to craft it then you simply just don&#039;t know, which can be very frustrating in your first few hours of game-play.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combat system is excellent in most regards, with various &#039;types&#039; of cannibal using different weapons and attack styles, some which include scaling trees or throwing Molotovs at your base; &amp;nbsp;while mutant cannibals having an entirely different set of skills, weaknesses and strengths.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;The AI in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Forest&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt; is great and really keeps players on their toes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for your own player, sometimes combat can feel clumsy, which isn&#039;t beneficial when you&#039;re outnumbered one to five (my advice in this situation is make a runner). A lot of patches have been put in place recently to counteract this, such as making the bow and arrow work properly, and it&#039;s good to see the developers coming back to these sorts of problems to enhance player satisfaction.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
