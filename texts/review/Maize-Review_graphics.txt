The graphics have their peaks and valleys. The peaks are the unique design of all the characters, the level design, and environmental art style that the game reaches for. The valleys are the amount of graphical and texture glitches that the game goes through as you progress in the story, as well as the isolated frame rate drops which sporadically occur. Other than those minor problems this is actually a very good looking game.&lt;br&gt;
