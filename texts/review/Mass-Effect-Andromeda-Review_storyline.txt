&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;ME:A&lt;/i&gt; is set 600 years after the events of the original trilogy, while also taking place in an entirely different galaxy. This creative decision cleverly results in sidestepping the controversial &lt;i&gt;Mass Effect 3&lt;/i&gt; ending while also providing enough context for the long journey to be conceivable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;You are Ryder, the human pathfinder. Your task is to find a new home for your species of the Milky Way in the Helius cluster. As the pioneer for humanity, it is up to you to explore mysterious worlds, uncover ancient tech and to communicate with new species.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt; of being an explorer is explored to great effect and the main story missions often provide memorable moments typical of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;. However, poor writing results in a puerile protagonist and tedious side quests nearly always derailing the momentum of the main plot.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
