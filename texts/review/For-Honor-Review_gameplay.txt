&lt;p&gt;The game is divided into three factions, Knights, Vikings and Samurai with each of them having four classes. Each class has a different role. All the heroes have a unique skill set and weapons.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;For Honor &lt;/i&gt;offers a whole new dynamic to the fighting genre. Timing and stratergy are of the essence. Players need to block, parry and strike precisely to take down the enemy. A few mistakes and you&#039;ll have your head on the ground.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The user must choose one of the three factions and partake in the online faction wars. There are a lot of game modes to choose from ranging from 1v1 to 4v4 matches.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although fun, the gameplay feels linear and lacking in depth. The multiplayer matches can quickly turn into a snowball of overpowering enemies if a player dies or disconnects. Steel, the in game currency, is rewarded sparsely after battles and makes progression an uphill climb.&lt;/p&gt;
