The wrath of Blackwell Academy has come down hard on Chloe Price. The episode begins with the expulsion of Chloe from the prestigious school. Even though we know this is an unavoidable eventuality due to the events of &lt;i&gt;Life Is Strange&lt;/i&gt;, it doesn&#039;t change the fact at how well the scene is crafted. The player has a choice, does she take the blame or does she let Rachel Amber take the fall?&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These morally grey choices are rampant throughout the whole episode and you will be confronted with some pretty daunting options. In this episode we really see Chloe and Rachel&#039;s relationship grow organically, in some of the most powerful scenes I have seen in a long time. Chloe is also gaining notoriety due to her association with her drug dealer, Frank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This episode shows the greatest, genuine character growth we have ever seen for Chloe. If you are invested in her story then several scenes in this episode will emotionally resonate with you. There is a reason she despises David in &lt;i&gt;LIS&lt;/i&gt;, there is a reason why she is so devastated when Rachel Amber goes missing. This episode shows us why, and it is done masterfully.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
