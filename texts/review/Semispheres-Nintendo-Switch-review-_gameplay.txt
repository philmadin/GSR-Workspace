The characters moved so elegantly throughout the levels and every aspect responded well to the joy-con controllers. In terms of puzzles - things heat up quickly, and there were definitely some levels I was stumped with. &lt;i&gt;Semispheres&lt;/i&gt; introduces new ideas well, and you are given the opportunity to hone your skills before being faced with a particularly challenging puzzle. The game also groups puzzles into sets of four and rewards the player with a story illustration each time a set is completed. This allows the the player to shoot for smaller goals and stops the puzzles from getting too frustrating or overwhelming.&amp;nbsp;One thing I really liked about playing on the Switch was that it also doubles as an accidental co-op game (just give a joy-con to a friend). While this does take away from the dual-control feature, it can be just as challenging trying to complete the puzzles with two conflicting brains.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
