Overall, &lt;i&gt;Xenoblade Chronicles 2&lt;/i&gt; is another resounding success for Nintendo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though perhaps a bit too niche for the mainstream appeal of &lt;i&gt;Mario&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Zelda&lt;/i&gt;, it nevertheless proves itself to be a worthy franchise for the Big N. Monolith Soft have once again illustrated why they are perhaps the best RPG studio in the world today, pumping out a fully-fledged &lt;i&gt;Xenoblade&lt;/i&gt; game within the first year of the Switch&#039;s lifespan, whilst offering genuinely clever twists on their patented formula.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I cannot recommend this game enough. &lt;br&gt;
