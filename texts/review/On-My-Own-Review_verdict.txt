A small fish in a big, swirling pond. <i>On My Own</i> is so peaceful to play it became a great way to relax after a long day. Young audiences will no doubt have hours of fun, but even an older player will likely find some pleasure in at least the idea of getting away from daily troubles.There definitely isn’t a great deal of complexity to the game, but sometimes…less is more. A great little addition to your games library.
