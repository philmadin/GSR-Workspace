I didn&#039;t expect to like &lt;i&gt;Kingdom Battle&lt;/i&gt;. I expected it to be a shameless amalgamation of universes to get some much-needed games onto the Switch - however, it&#039;s that amalgamation of universes that make &lt;i&gt;Kingdom Battle&lt;/i&gt; so brilliant. Providing a unique take on the turn-based genre, it introduces new concepts and gameplay elements that challenge you to make the most of them. Place this in a beautiful world full of charm and character, and you&#039;ve got a game that not only screams for your attention, it deserves it.
