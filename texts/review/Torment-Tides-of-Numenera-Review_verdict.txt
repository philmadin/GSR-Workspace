&lt;p&gt;The absolute highlight of this game is just how delicious the style of gameplay is. A complete throwback to the kind you would encounter in titles like Diablo II and Balder&#039;s Gate that came out over a decade ago; it&#039;s slow, it&#039;s simple, it&#039;s very fun, and sometimes very funny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, like a lot of games, Torment: Tides of Numenera has its downfalls. Too many loading screens, annoying combat modes, weird lookin&#039; dudes. But overall, the game is stellar, and backers of the Kickstarter will be pleased to know their money has gone towards something that&#039;ll keep them entertained for hours.&lt;/p&gt;
