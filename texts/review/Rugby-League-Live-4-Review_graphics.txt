Rugby League Live 4&#039;s graphics are a classic case of a game that has been rushed to market. Although to be fair, Rugby League Live 4 doesn&#039;t look as bad as the first State Of Origin trailer made it look (the game looked like it belonged on the PS2). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rugby League Live 4 doesn&#039;t look like a game on the next gen consoles should. The character models leave a lot to be desired and are very limited; the crowd models, on the other hand, are probably the best I have seen in a sports game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other than the overall graphics issues, a positive&amp;nbsp;to take away from Rugby League Live 4 is that the stadiums have been perfectly recreated and look quite like they do in real life, so top marks for that.
