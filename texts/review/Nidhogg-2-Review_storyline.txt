The games&#039; designer says there&#039;s a story here somewhere, but I cannot find it. Maybe it&#039;s hidden in the carvings of cave walls or in the background environments. Perhaps there&#039;s some hidden secret in the nightclub or swamp levels. I don&#039;t know. If there is one, and we&#039;re told there is, then it&#039;s either very difficult to find or so obscure it might as well not exist.
