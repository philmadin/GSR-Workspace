I can&#039;t say enough great things about &lt;i&gt;Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus&lt;/i&gt;. It is an insanely fun run through an engrossing and gripping story, which made me truly care about all the characters involved. Coupled with stellar graphics and a soundtrack that will pump you up enough to make that insanely dangerous shot, or sprint through the level melee killing anyone in sight in search of Mecha Hitler. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus&lt;/i&gt; is really Game of the Year material in a year that&#039;s stacked with great games.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Review copy provided by Bethesda Softworks.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
