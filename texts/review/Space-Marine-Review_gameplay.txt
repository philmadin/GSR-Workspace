Blast your way through a variety of increasingly angry green aliens, cut through your foes with a number of brutal weapons and destroy anything that stands in your way. Space Marine is perfectly refined. Melee combat is unflinchingly violent and brutally satisfying. Bolter weapons knock down Orks with ease, melta-guns disintegrate anything in front of them and explosives tear their targets apart.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To stay alive you must close with your foe to execute them, decapitation, bisection and evisceration are all on the table and it brings a manic, frenetic beauty to what would otherwise be a fairly standard shooter.&lt;/p&gt;
