&lt;p&gt;The soundtrack is a clever mix of new and familiar - catchy music with punchy sound effects, and you&#039;ll quite often hear something that will take you back down memory lane. We are in the Mushroom Kingdom after all!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did have one small issue with the dialogue or lack thereof. Grunts, whoops, beeps and BWAAAHs are the staples here, and I found myself craving spoken words to break things up.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
