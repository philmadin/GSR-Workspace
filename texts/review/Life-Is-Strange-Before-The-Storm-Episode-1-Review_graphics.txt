&lt;i&gt;Life Is Strange&lt;/i&gt; has a very particular art direction and &lt;i&gt;Before The Storm&lt;/i&gt; adheres to it perfectly. It&#039;s basically the same as it was in 2015 just with clearer resolution. It&#039;s not going to knock your socks off but it feels homely. Not to mention there are absolutely no lip syncing issues this time around and I found no technical bugs in my playthrough.
