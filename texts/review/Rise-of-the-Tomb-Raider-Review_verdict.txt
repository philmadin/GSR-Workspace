&lt;p&gt;Tomb Raider 2013 set the bar very high and somehow Rise of the Tomb Raider gallivants right over it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the story is very generic and somewhat predictable but it is fun. The gameplay is very linear and the progression system isn&#039;t very rewarding but apart from that, the game did not give me a chance to complain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether or not you are a Tomb raider fan, if you like third person action games, Tomb raider will live up to your expectations and with the story ending on a massive cliffhanger, the sequel can&#039;t come soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;
