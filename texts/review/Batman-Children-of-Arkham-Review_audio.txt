<br>Since the stakes are rising higher and higher in Gotham, it is appropriate that the voice actors performances do as well. A round of applause to Laura Bailey (Selina Kyle) and Travis Willingham (Harvey Dent) who really knock it out of the park this time around. Troy Baker (Bruce Wayne/Batman) perfectly exudes the conflict within Bruce Wayne while still remaining completely intimidating as our caped crusader. Jason Spisaks (Penguin) in game speech is also wonderfully demented.&nbsp;
