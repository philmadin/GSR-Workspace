Some of the imagery in this episode is truly breathtaking. Cinematic quality to be sure. The opening segment in the bathroom features no dialogue whatsoever, yet it is one of the most visually important scenes of the season. Chloe&#039;s graffiti is also really starting to convey insight into her character, whether it be a poorly drawn joint on a school wall or a regretful journal entry meant for Max.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This game feels like there is so much thought put into the smaller details. Details that could easily be glossed over or missed. These small touches are what make a video game feel real, not only for the character we are playing as, but also as players.&lt;/p&gt;
