If you came into Sonic Forces expecting a new spin on the Sonic formula, then I&#039;m afraid I&#039;ve got some bad news. While this is a more polished and complete Sonic game that some fans could enjoy, there are a lot of gameplay elements that hinder this from being a great game to play. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The gameplay is jarring in the way that it switches between 3rd person and side scrolling perspectives, making the levels hard and incapable of flowing smoothly - and really just disrupts the flow that the developers were trying to create on each stage, thus making the game a chore to progress through. The boss battles are not much better, with poor A.I, repetitive attack patterns, and really just uninspired gameplay overall. &lt;i&gt;Sonic Forces &lt;/i&gt;really falls flat when it comes to something that the Sonic series is widely known for.&lt;br&gt;
