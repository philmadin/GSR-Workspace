In spite of its out-dated design and some rough edges, Herald is an enjoyable experience. I constantly found myself wanting to see what happens next, and a sign of good narrative is that I didn&#039;t realise that was happening. A second playthrough did taint the experience for me but keep it to one and you&#039;ll be captivated. With two more books in development, we still don&#039;t know the fate or direction of the HLV Herald - but I do know I&#039;m looking forward to continuing Devan&#039;s story.
