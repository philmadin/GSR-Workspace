&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake, Hellion is hard - there is no tutorial, guide or hand holding to get you started. That said, it is certainly plausible that someone who has been in cryo-sleep for the last century has no idea what&#039;s going on and probably doesn&#039;t have any training on what to do in this situation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I accidentally depressurised the outpost the first three attempts, draining all oxygen and shooting myself out into space like a missile. I did find a space suit, but then struggled with movement and oxygen supplies. I discovered a nearby airlock module that would allow me to enter/exit safely, however successfully attaching that to the outpost took another 8 respawns.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next thing I found was a ship, but with no idea how to fly it, I crashed into the outpost, sending us both flying off in opposite directions. On the next respawn I was able to dock the ship to the outpost, but then realised I&#039;d docked onto the wrong port and couldn&#039;t move into the station.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually I managed to connect everything together and get the systems back to a functioning state, and then came the scary proposition of firing up the FTL drive and exploring to collect more resources... cue more deaths. Keep in mind that every option available to you does make logical sense, but you have to know what you are trying to achieve if you want any chance at success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what Hellion is about. Trial and error. Finding out what works and what doesn&#039;t. When surviving with limited resources you won&#039;t always have a positive outcome, but when you finally succeed in completing something as small as refilling an oxygen tank, you are filled with a genuine sense of accomplishment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full Newtonian physics are in play, making movement in zero gravity challenging - be prepared to be patient and take things very VERY slowly. There is also a loose multiplayer element to either work with or take advantage of other players, and with extra features such as salvaging/crafting, base building and combat still to be implemented, I honestly feel like the best is yet to come.&lt;/p&gt;
