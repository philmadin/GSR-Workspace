The gameplay is once again fairly strong. There is a healthy balance of hard decisions and simple puzzle activities. There is nothing tedious such as the infamous bottle segment in the first season, the developers have clearly responded to the criticisms aimed at its predecessor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead there is a wondrous segment in the junkyard where we simply get to customise Chloe&#039;s car with different items. Giving the player the opportunity to express Chloe&#039;s personality through cosmetic decorations was a great gameplay choice. This environmental storytelling is part of the reason why the entire episode remains engaging throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
