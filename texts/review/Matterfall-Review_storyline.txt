The story for&lt;i&gt; Matterfall&lt;/i&gt; is briefly described in the opening cinematic. Your name is Avalon Darrow and you are a Freelancer whose purpose is to destroy the alien threat. Due to the aggressiveness of the foreign technology, you will also need to rescue civilians and help them evacuate. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From that point, it is only the completion of the level that becomes important. There is no further information or real lore which is disappointing.&lt;br&gt;
