&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;Containing ultra-neon colours against a black background, &lt;i style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;Pudi&lt;/i&gt; feels very reminiscent of a Tron-like universe. Colours pop and are incredibly sharp, fitting this style of game perfectly. The interface is also very minimal helping with the whole aesthetic.&lt;/span&gt;
