<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 108%">Hailing from2012, <i style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 108%">Spec Ops</i> has aged well for a game with a photo-realistic style.The models and animations are crisp and pleasant to look at, theeffects are top notch and the way small visual cues are used todisplay the state of the characters still holds up.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 108%">The most notablepart of the visual spectacle is the sand, the way it flows as itcascades down from Dubaiâ€™s skyscrapers, the way it sprays ashundreds of bullets skip across its surface and the way itencompasses anyone unfortunate enough to become trapped in it.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 108%">The game runsvery well, especially for one that looks as good as it does. For agame made by a smaller team it outperforms many titles that arereleased even today and has little trouble competing with similargames on the market at the time.</p>
