Even though the bright visual aesthetics of the game are a bit repetitive and toyish, the funny Rastafarian accent of the aliens makes it an easy going experience. The user interface could do with a bit more detailed tooltip aspect. Its not very hard to visually get around the game, but it certainly could be more informative and easier. In any case, I found the intro video to be quite clever and hilarious.
