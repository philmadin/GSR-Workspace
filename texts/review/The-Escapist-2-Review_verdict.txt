&lt;i&gt;The Escapist 2&lt;/i&gt; is a fun, yet brutally hard game. I have spent what feels like an actual prison sentence, trying to bust out of each prison. The gameplay is simple and easy to pick up and play, the seamless online multiplayer in my opinion is the stand out of feature of the game because of how it makes playing with friends easier than most other co-op games ever have. In my opinion that is a selling point in itself.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;
