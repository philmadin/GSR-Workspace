The audio of &lt;i&gt;WRC 7&lt;/i&gt; is perfect. There is no overbearing soundtrack to mute your co-driver mid-race, because anyone who has played a rally game knows just how important being able to hear your co-driver is to successfully complete a track. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The menu music is a healthy mix of rock and pop, which are good to get players in the mood before a race. The cars all sound realistic which is great for player immersion and making the player feel like they are actually watching a real WRC race on TV (so in essence, a revheads delight). &lt;br&gt;
