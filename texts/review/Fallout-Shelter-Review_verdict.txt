<p class="MsoNormal">Fallout Shelter is a decently fun time waster that thankfully avoids the pay to win model that plagues the genre. But it’s a storyof missed opportunities. &nbsp;No multiplayer functionality at all is a glaring omission and something that could’ve really given the game some sorely needed depth and replayability. It’s a slickly presented title but ultimately shallow, and that’s a shame.<o:p></o:p></p>
