&lt;i&gt;Wartile&lt;/i&gt; is an RTS game like few others, doing away with the standard turn-based system. It feels smooth by imposing a movement limit when exploring, and using cooldown time on every turn so that the player cannot spam moves. Combat is much easier than other RTS games, in that your character can attack freely and most of the enemies will advance on your characters once they are alerted. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wartile&lt;/i&gt; has the normal RPG progression and customization system of games in this genre, and the quest layout is nice and simple as well. Once the tutorial has been completed, you can visit the map in the game hub and from there you can select a new quest to embark on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All up&lt;i&gt; Wartile&lt;/i&gt; takes some risks, but at the end of the day they all work out in the game&#039;s favor; everything works together well and makes it easy for anyone to pick up and play.&lt;br&gt;
