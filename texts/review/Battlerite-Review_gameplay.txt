&lt;i&gt;Battlerite &lt;/i&gt;is the successor to&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Bloodline Champions&lt;/i&gt; (also by Stunlock Studios). Though the gameplay is essentially the same as&lt;i&gt; Bloodline,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;some changes to mechanics have been made in &lt;i&gt;Battlerite, &lt;/i&gt;along with improvements to the look and feel of the game.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are 4 different modes to try. Unlike most PvP games, &lt;i&gt;Battlerite&#039;s &lt;/i&gt;matches are quick and exhilarating. Each round lasts only a few minutes in which lightning quick decisions and precise control over the keyboard and mouse are essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This makes the game a bit hard to master at first, but not so much that it will drain out all the fun from the gameplay. It&#039;s best if new users&amp;nbsp; try out a few matches with AI opponents before heading out to the online arena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honing your skills to face tougher opponents requires you to get comfortable with the controls. To do this, I&#039;d recommend finding a single champion whose play style &quot;fits&quot; you the best and practicing with him/her for a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are quite a lot of different characters to choose from. They can be further customised to suit your play style using ability enhancing &#039;battlerites&#039;. Each champion also has their own loadouts for visual customisation. In any case, trying out different champions is really fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The developers have really structured and balanced the champions and their abilities wisely. This gives you a chance to decide on the play style which works for you .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
