<i>Cossacks 3</i> is the latest game in the <i>Cossacks</i> series, a group of strategy titles that take place during the 17th and 18th centuries. It's a call back to classic strategy like <i>Age of Empires</i> or <i>Rise of Nations,</i> but unfortunately never quite manages to reach those same heights.
