&lt;p&gt;The gameplay in itself hasn&#039;t changed/upgraded from the main instalment of the series - hosting the usual waves of adds, puzzles to decipher, dodgy traps and boss fights. I spoke with other players in the community, and they loved the fact that this DLC felt much like the Mages Guild Questline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside this is the new 12-player Trial, which has been reported to be completed in just over an hour in Veteran mode. This may sound limiting, but there&#039;s more on the menu than just the storyline and Trial.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major aspect that I highly disregard, is ESO&#039;s flavour of questing, which is the weighty duration of running to and from quest givers - even with a mount this can feel like the most boring part of the series. Albeit some fans of the series do like this facet of the game.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
