&lt;i&gt;Offensive Combat: Redux!&lt;/i&gt; looked promising from the get go, but quickly lost substance and depth that is needed to keep a player engulfed in a game for a long time. It is a First Person Shooter with a bit of a twist.&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game is rather easy to pick up and play, and doesn&#039;t have a steep learning curve. However, this also leads to the game looking uninspred and a bit boring.&lt;/p&gt;
