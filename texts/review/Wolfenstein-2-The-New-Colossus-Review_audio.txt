This game&amp;nbsp;has some of the best audio I have ever encountered in a first-person shooter. The voice acting alone is delivered with so much emotion and passion, that I wish there were an Academy Awards for gaming - so that the entire voice acting team could get the praise that they deserve.&lt;br style=&quot;white-space: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;br style=&quot;white-space: normal;&quot;&gt;The ambient level of music is superb.&amp;nbsp; This game can have the ability to both calm the player with safety, and can also suddenly galvanise into combat, crumbling the calming facade. The DOOM-esk metal soundtracks can&amp;nbsp;roar&amp;nbsp;to life and pump the player up to a level where they suddenly find themselves caked in enough enemy blood to fill the local blood bank. &lt;br style=&quot;white-space: normal;&quot;&gt;
