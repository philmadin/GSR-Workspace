To conclude, there really isn’t anything negative to say about The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask 3D. This is a sublime package; one that has been refined to the nth degree. However, the reason why it hasn’t been given a perfect score is because of how divisive it may be to players. Many will love – and many will no doubt hate it, due to how un-Zelda it really is. If you’re looking for something different, though, you can do much worse than checking this out.
