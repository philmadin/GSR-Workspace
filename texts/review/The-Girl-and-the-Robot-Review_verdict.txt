&lt;i&gt;The Girl and The Robot&lt;/i&gt; is one of the more interesting games I&#039;ve played this year and is certainly the most endearing. Despite its small flaws and short play time I was left wanting more. &lt;i&gt;The Girl and The Robot &lt;/i&gt;is definitely worth playing if you get the chance.
