When you first pick up Rugby League Live 4, it can take a while for you to get a handle on the controls. The tutorial is not the least bit helpful. If anything, it will have you more confused at what to do than anything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The gameplay itself is not that much of an improvement on Rugby League Live 3, but it makes some improvements in making the flow of the game a bit smoother. At least, until you make your way to the kicking mini-game which seems to make up its own mind as to whether you have made the kick or not based on your distance from the goal posts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The main thing that the developers have nailed is how much the referees send obvious try line decisions to the Bunker, and how much the Bunker bungles those obvious decisions; which provides a true sense of immersion for NRL fans.&lt;br&gt;
