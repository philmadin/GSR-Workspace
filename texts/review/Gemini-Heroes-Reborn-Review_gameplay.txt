The five powers in Gemini creatively complement each other. The time jump is initially used for puzzle-platforming gameplay which, alongside the style of the environments, was reminiscent of Portal 2. In the later stages, it allows the player extensive creativity in combat as the gameplay de-emphasizes puzzles in lieu of action.<br />

Time slow is Gemini's greatest achievement, creating great opportunities for mischief alongside telekinesis as well as some awesome imagery of combat frozen in time.<br />

The "easter eggs" the game toted were disappointingly more like collectibles. Also disappointing was the gameplay in the first boss battle, which seemed like a copy-paste from a superhero game of 10 years ago.<br />

Gemini allows the player to catch bullets in mid-air, go back in time, and put those same bullets through a previously-kidnapped enemy's skull. Even with the few gameplay glitches I ran into, I have nothing but praise for this incredible (time) leap forward in superhero gameplay.
