It's irritating that the game is online only, relying on EA servers and the PlayStation Network to be available for the game makes it unreliable. Often, the game had to be closed and restarted as no new missions became available after completing them all. The racetrack would also disappear due to server lag, leaving no choice but to restart the race. With the PS4 version, there were also minor framerate drops.<br />

Need for Speed is successful in recapturing the arcade magic of previous entries like Underground and Most Wanted. With some tweaking, this franchise could become even better. There is nothing better than racing at nail biting speeds in a visually pretty city.
