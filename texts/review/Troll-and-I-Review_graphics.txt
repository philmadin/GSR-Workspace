The world of &lt;i&gt;Troll and I&lt;/i&gt; looks great and feels like a graphic novel, similar to the look of the &lt;i&gt;State of Decay &lt;/i&gt;series. Unfortunately, this doesn&#039;t extend into the design of the characters, with their rendering quality looking like it belongs with last generation consoles. The stationary animations of the characters sometimes jump from textured to smooth rendering at a constant rate, depending on how long you stand still.&lt;br&gt;
