&lt;p&gt;While the writing, animation, and voice acting is already amazing, the soundtrack tops it off and completes the heavy direction of the series. From &#039;Trisha&#039;s Lullaby&#039; to &#039;Mount Briggs ~Overture~&#039;, each track captures the scene and emotion that&#039;s behind it. It makes each emotional scene hit that much harder.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each part of &lt;i&gt;Brotherhood&lt;/i&gt; plays it&#039;s part to make sure it&#039;s an emotional series that&#039;s beautifully animated and written. With the humour that also plays its part in the series, it&#039;s an extremely well made series that has a lot of care put into it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
