<p class="MsoNormal"><i>The Bunker</i> taps into an old style of video game where you watch the action unfold instead of having complete control. Replayability is limited as there are no branching options which leaves something to be desired. Some players may find this tedious as it is no more than a two-hour film with point and click style options, but the story driving you to the end is worth the playthrough at least once.<o:p></o:p></p>
