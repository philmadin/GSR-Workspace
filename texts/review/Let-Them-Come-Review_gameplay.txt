&lt;i&gt;Let Them Come&lt;/i&gt;&#039;s gameplay is truly a case of less is more. It&#039;s basic in its design, yet immensely fun when put into action (I guess there&#039;s something really fun about mowing down alien hordes). The action goes from zero to one hundred in what feels like milliseconds, as the waves of aliens begin to pile up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The progress is easy enough to follow - beat waves of aliens, get currency, obtain upgrades to make you deadlier than John Rambo in a paintball match, and slay all manner of different beasts. Easy enough, right?&lt;br&gt;
