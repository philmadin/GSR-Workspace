<i><br>The Final Station's </i>story is mostly told through environmental visuals, notes pasted around the world and the conversations of your passengers.<br><br><br>You are the conductor, driver and engineer of the train Belus 07, the last working transport available. Your mission is a simple one. Deliver government cargo and any survivors you come across.<br><br><br>The story through which you play is not overly engaging but the one you find littered about the places you visit or notice through visual cues is certainly worth it. I will not spoil it as I myself am not 100% sure of what's is going on which certainly makes for an interesting experience. <br>
