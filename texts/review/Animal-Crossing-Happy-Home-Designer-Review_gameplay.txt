Designing homes has never been easier. You can drag, drop, rotate and even multiply furniture all through the touch screen. It’s easy to access the catalogue with all the pieces of furniture and to search for just the right piece to make a home perfect. <br />

Villagers will give you a theme and you have to work within that. Characters such as K.K Slider and Isabelle (that you get through the Amiibo cards) dish out extra challenges. This is because you’re completely left up to your devices and have no set theme to work with. You can also compare your own creations to what other people have done through the Happy Home Network. <br />

As satisfying as it is to design a villager’s home, it might get tiring after a while. After all, that’s all there is to the game. It’s simple and repetitive gameplay that’s perfect for someone who only wants to play for 30 minutes a day.   <br />
