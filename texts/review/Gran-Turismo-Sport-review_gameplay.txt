As is to be expected with &lt;i&gt;Gran Turismo&lt;/i&gt; titles, the gameplay is a step ahead of all other racing games. The driving mechanics are crisp and the handling feels as close to real life as I have ever played, which makes speeding along these intricately designed tracks an easy and enjoyable experience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This game is probably best played with a steering wheel. It just feels so natural that I must say that for anyone wanting to get into legal track racing, this is probably the best way to train for it if you don&#039;t have an extra $100,000 laying around. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I played this at EB Expo in VR and I must say that it was an awesome experience. Everything feels so real and the car is so immaculately rendered that if you didn&#039;t have a big headset on, you could totally feel like you are in one of these terribly expensive cars.&lt;br&gt;
