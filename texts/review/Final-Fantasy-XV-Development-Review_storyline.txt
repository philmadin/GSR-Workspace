This is definitely the longest campaign in the history of the franchise. It makes <i>Skyrim</i> look like freakin' <i>Star Wars: Battlefront</i>.<br><br>Get it? Because that game doesn't <i>have</i> a campaign! Ha <i>Ha</i>!<br><br>Anyways, the ten-year long story is full of twists and turns. Initially taking place on the PlayStation 3, the game then eventually moves to the PS4 for the second act.<br><br>In a huge plot twist, an American console then muscles in on the action, much to the bemusement of many.<br><br>Xbox One. It's Xbox One. Spoilers.<br><br>Also, the game pulls a Kojima by changing protagonists. Starting with Tetsuya Nomura, he eventually dies by drowning in a sea of zippers and black leather, before Hajime Tabata steps in. It's here where the narrative really starts moving at a faster pace - almost as if it was determined to actually finish!<br>
