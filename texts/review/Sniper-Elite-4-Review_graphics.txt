While not reaching the graphical height of games like Uncharted 4, the terrain you traverse is undeniably beautiful.&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you&#039;re hunting in the jungle or an Italian cottage, the environments work together with the audio to immerse you into a run-down, lived-in world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the environments are impressive, they aren&#039;t particularly memorable, or offer anything to the World War II gaming genre that hasn&#039;t been seen before. The face models are a massive improvement over Sniper Elite III, giving the solid performances from the cast added life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
