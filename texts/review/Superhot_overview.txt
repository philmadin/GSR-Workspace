<p class="MsoNormal">Superhot is a unique first person shooter borne of the 7DFPS Jam back in 2013, a competition that required the development team to make the game from the ground up in only a week. The prototype of the game was so popular that a Kickstarter campaign for a commercial version received over $250,000 and is now available on PC, with Mac and Xbox One versions to follow.<o:p></o:p></p>
