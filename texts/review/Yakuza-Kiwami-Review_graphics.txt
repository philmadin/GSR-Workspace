The game&#039;s graphics have simply been remastered to new-gen consoles&#039; standards. The world of Kamurocho is perfectly replicated, and so are all of the NPCs. There isn&#039;t much more to say about the visuals of Yakuza Kiwami, the game has been rebuilt, and it looks fine. I wasn&#039;t expecting any amazing new additions to the game and that&#039;s just also fine because it&#039;s all the game needed.&lt;br&gt;
