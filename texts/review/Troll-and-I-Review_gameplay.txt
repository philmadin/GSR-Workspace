&lt;i&gt;Troll and I&lt;/i&gt; is a third person action-adventure,with straightforward puzzles that require both Otto and the troll working together to complete them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The combat in &lt;i&gt;Troll and I&lt;/i&gt; is clunky and it&#039;s often difficult to defeat even the most basic enemies.The camera is too close to the character, often making viewing the world difficult with Otto and even harder with the larger troll. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game is also plagued by too many quick time events. These don&#039;t add anything to the game, instead just serving as a faster way to move you along the world and one step closer to yet another non-engaging cut scene. &lt;br&gt;
