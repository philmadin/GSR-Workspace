It is so rare to find an excellent prequel in any form of media. Star Wars, Alien, so on and so forth. They couldn&#039;t get it right, but Deck Nine could. The first episode of &lt;i&gt;Before The Storm &lt;/i&gt;is one of the most touching video game experiences I&#039;ve had since the original &lt;i&gt;LIS&lt;/i&gt;. I implore anyone who enjoys poignant single player stories to check this one out. A great starting point for newcomers and an absolute delight for series fanatics. Hopefully the rest of the season can reach the heights of this marvelous introduction.
