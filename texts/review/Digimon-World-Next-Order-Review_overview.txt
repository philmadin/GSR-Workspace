If you&#039;re expecting a &lt;i&gt;Digimon &lt;/i&gt;game where you pick your favourite Digimon and go around fighting, think again.&lt;i&gt; Digimon World: Next Order &lt;/i&gt;is aimed at the dedicated few that focus on stats and grinding, which quickly drains the excitement from the game.&lt;br&gt;
