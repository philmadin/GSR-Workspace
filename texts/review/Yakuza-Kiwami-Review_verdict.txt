All things considered, Yakuza Kiwami is an amazing entry point into the series, both for fans of the original Yakuza and for new-comers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yakuza Kiwami is an example of how a game with a huge focus on storytelling can also have great gameplay that can entertain players for hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game looks and sounds great, SEGA really went out of the way to make sure that Yakuza Kiwami is not just a cheap cash grab, and has absolutely nailed the look and feel of the first game.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
