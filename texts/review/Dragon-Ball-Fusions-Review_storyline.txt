Here you control a silent protagonist who, through the power of the Dragon Balls, creates a rift in time and space that brings every notable martial artist together to compete in a tournament to end all tournaments. To achieve your goal to be the very best, you must recruit various characters from the Dragon Ball universe in order to build the ultimate five-man team.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&#039;re a long-time Dragon Ball fan, there&#039;s a lot here to enjoy. Encountering and fighting with virtually every character to ever exist in the franchise&#039;s 33 year history is a lot of fun, but the overarching plot revolving around the tournament is cliche fare. Dragon Ball Fusions&#039;s story is not accommodating for those unfamiliar with the series; the character moments and motivations are sure to go completely over their heads.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
