<i>Payday 2 </i>is undeniably fun. It's an incredible time sync and the developers are constantly adding content through free updates and DLC. While it isn't a perfect game, and probably never will be, it's worth playing if you want a good, wholesome, heisting experience. I highly recommend it though one must be aware of the numerous issues.
