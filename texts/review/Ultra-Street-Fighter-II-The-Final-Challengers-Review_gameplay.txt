&lt;p&gt;In terms of gameplay, &lt;i&gt;Ultra Street Fighter II &lt;/i&gt;is what you&#039;d expect from a &lt;i&gt;Street Fighter II &lt;/i&gt;port; well-balanced characters, satisfying punches and tight mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on &lt;i&gt;Super Street Fighter II Turbo&lt;/i&gt;, the core game has strangely eschewed the refinements made in the nine year old &lt;i&gt;Turbo HD &lt;/i&gt;in favour of a new balancing system combined with grapple breaks and a more forgiving combo system. There&#039;s also a &#039;Lite&#039; control scheme for beginners, which relegates special moves to a button press or the Switch&#039;s touchscreen (in portable mode only, obviously). So, nothing too bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, when it comes to content, the game suffers tremendously. First of all, local and online multiplayer is handled very well - which is expected. Playing in tabletop mode with two folks outside never ceases to be tremendous fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two new characters added to the roster, bumping up the final tally to 19. Evil Ryu and Violent Ken offer some welcome variety, with the latter being an&amp;nbsp;&#039;Akumafied&#039; version of Ryu, and the latter being a faster version of Ken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddy Battle is a peculiar co-op mode which pits two fighters against one, with the difficulty ramping up in each bout until the players&#039; shared health meter is depleted&amp;nbsp;(or is hit once, with the one KO mode).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even stranger is the Way of the Hado mode, which is a 3D first person minigame where players have to hold a Joy-Con in each hand, whilst pretending to shoot Ryu&#039;s special moves at waves of Shadaloo goons (and M. Bison himself). With three difficulties, an endless mode and the ability to level-up your Ryu, its harmless fun - albeit fun that is blighted by inconsistent motion controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is a colour editor for fighter customisation, and an art gallery of 1400 pictures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This all sounds fine, but the big issue here is one of price. Simply, Capcom are asking for way too much for a package that contains relatively little. There are older&lt;i&gt; Street Fighter &lt;/i&gt;games (like &lt;i&gt;SFIV &lt;/i&gt;on 3DS) that are cheap as chips, and contain far more stuff. For the supposed &#039;Ultra&#039; version of &lt;i&gt;SFII&lt;/i&gt;, they could have &lt;i&gt;at least &lt;/i&gt;included the 1994 animated movie, as was included in past versions. There isn&#039;t even a speed select, nor&amp;nbsp;bonus stages in arcade mode!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
