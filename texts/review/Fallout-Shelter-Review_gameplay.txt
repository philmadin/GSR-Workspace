<p class="MsoNormal">Fallout Shelter is simple and accessible. With a handful of citizens and a few caps (the in-game currency), you must build rooms that cater to their needs. Power generators, diners, water treatment plants and living quarters must be manned by your population to function, and juggling man powerto ensure you have enough food, water and power can be tough. Throw in the threat of rad roaches, raider attacks and weirdly common spontaneous fires andyou’ll be very busy early on.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">Sadly that’s where the game peaks.&nbsp; As you unlock more room upgrades and your vault's population grows the difficulty actually decreases. After you’ve armed everyone with your surplus of weapons and armor, the fear of outside threats basically vanishes. <o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">After a few hours youwill find yourself with plenty of dwellers milling around doing nothing, and resources and caps aplenty. &nbsp;And unfortunately there just isn’t enough depth to the leveling up system, or the &nbsp;crafting, to keep drawing you back in.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">The much talked about ability to select who breeds in your vault sounds cool, potentially opening up another avenue to customise your population. And it's interesting, at least initially, but inevitably ends in a creepy, eugenics style breeding program, with the smartest and strongest being locked in the living quarters and pumping out babies non stop.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">There’s no real exploration of the wasteland either, instead just the option to equip your citizens with gear and eject them from the vault in search of caps and better equipment.<o:p></o:p></p>
