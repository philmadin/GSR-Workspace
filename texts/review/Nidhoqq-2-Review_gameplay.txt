Nidhogg 2 is all about the gameplay, and damn, is it good. There&#039;s several weapons, namely a rapier, a broadsword, a knife and a bow, all of which have their own pros and cons. The movement is a beast all of its own as well with slides, rolls, crawls, jumps, flips and, of course, a lot of running. But what&#039;s the point? I&#039;ll tell you.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TO STAB THE OTHER GUY. It really is that simple. One hit and he&#039;s dead, the same goes for you. But to achieve that requires a surprising amount of skill. Like any good fighting game, timing, attacking and blocking and movement is key as you parry attacks, disarm your opponent and pull all sorts of ridiculous moves that you&#039;ll swear were intentional but we all know were a total fluke. It&#039;s a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only real issue is regarding the online component as the game slows down considerably. There appears to be a substantial connection problem, though I hear the devs are looking into it. Other than this, it&#039;s perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
