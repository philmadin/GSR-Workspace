As a package, <i>Super Mario Maker</i> is remarkably similar to its home console brethren. All four graphical styles return, in addition to most of the creation tools (Amiibo compatibility and sound recordings don't make the cut, unfortunately). <br><br>Still, you do obtain all of the stuff to play with almost immediately, which will undoubtedly come to the relief of those who disliked the original's approach of making you wait a certain time-frame. <br><br>However, new players need no worry about feeling overwhelmed, as lessons are available in order to ease you into the whole thing, and they're hosted by the delightful pigeon Yamamura and customer service lady Mashiko (who were a hidden highlight of Mario Maker's digital manual).<br><br>The 100 Mario Challenge mode also returns, with all difficulty settings unlocked from the off.
