Given Hellion is in Alpha stage, it is expected that there are rough edges. The assets that are currently implemented&amp;nbsp;however show a great amount of promise. Textures are incredibly detailed, there are some beautifully realistic lighting effects and models look like they belong in the 23rd Century timeline. Most importantly, you feel immersed as everything looks and feels how it should.
