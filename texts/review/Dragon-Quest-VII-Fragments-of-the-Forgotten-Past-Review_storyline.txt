<br>The story of <i>Dragon Quest VII </i>is quite unique in its delivery. Much like <i>Dragon Quest IV</i>, the game is split into chapters, but here, there's a far greater scope in its mini-tales.<br><br><br>As is tradition, you start the tale as the eponymous 'hero', who lives in a small fishing village on a tiny island that sits in an endless expanse of ocean. Initially, this seems all that there is to the world of Estard, but one day, the hero's father brings home a map, which shows that there once existed continents. Eventually, he and his friend, Prince Kiefer, manage to travel back in time, and find that the long-forgotten lands are under the thrall of a black magic, which has caused them to vanish from reality.<br><br><br>This is the foundation for <i>Dragon Quest VII's</i> mammoth yarn, as you journey across the world to solve woes, meet friends, and restore countries to their rightful place. As is RPG tradition, you'll eventually accrue a party of heroes, such as the wayward Kiefer, the pushy Maribel and the wolf-turned-human (and personal favourite of mine) Ruff. As you helped the various realms of Estard in the past, they then emerge in the present, opening up even more adventures.<br><br><br>Truly, <i>Dragon Quest VII</i> is a gigantic title. The main campaign alone will take about 100 hours to complete, so it's a good thing that the story is both hilarious, gripping and (surprisingly) sad. Taking an incredible three years to localise from Japanese, the translators and writers have done a truly amazing job in fleshing out the world of Estard. Every region has its own dialect, so you'll come across people speaking cockney English, Scottish, French and more, complete with specific slang that really highlights the attention to detail. Personally, I really loved this, and it often resulted in some truly funny exchanges between characters.<br><br><br>Because the narrative is split into individual arcs, it makes it perfectly suited to the handheld 3DS. The game even comes with a composition of past stories that allow players to catch up on what is happening, should they leave the game for a while - though this didn't apply to me, as I couldn't put it down!<br>
