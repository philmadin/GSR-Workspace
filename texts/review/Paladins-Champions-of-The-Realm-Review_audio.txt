&lt;i&gt;Paladins: Champions of The Realm&lt;/i&gt; has a very basic fantasy soundtrack. A lot of swelling battlefield music is used to get you ready for the match and a calm musical score is used for the main menu screen. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for most games in the first person, team shooter genre, the character voice acting is what makes it stand out, with sound bites from each champion gives you an insight into their personality and motivation for why they battle. Some are fighting because that is all they know, and some just want to bring peace to their homes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All the champions express themselves through how they look and sound which makes &lt;i&gt;Paladins: Champions of The Realm&lt;/i&gt; audio one of the most important and well-managed parts of the game.&lt;br&gt;
