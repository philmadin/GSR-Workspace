<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Long before the events of <i>Destiny</i>, The Iron Lords were the Guardians that protected what remained of civilisation. During their reign they uncovered SIVA, a nanotechnological masterwork intended to repair and build upon what was lost in the Collapse. SIVA didn’t fancy that idea and turned against them, ultimately being sealed away underground. Now the Fallen have their hands on SIVA and you are tasked with&nbsp;</span>eradicating it permanently.</p><p class="p1"><br></p><p class="p1"><br></p><p class="p2">Cloak and Dagger storytelling never really worked for <i>Destiny</i>, thus, being handed context upfront is appreciated, if still bland. It is quite a short tale as ever with the main quest line itself being a short few missions. The story does continue on through strikes and the Raid, but these aren’t focused on providing any sort of tale.</p><p class="p2"><br></p><p class="p2"><br></p><p class="p2">With Lord Saladin being a recurring face in the Tower for Iron Banner, it’s almost a let down to finally hang out with the man. Stoic and melancholy, Saladin could be an inspiring focal point for a narrative, but instead he remains on his mountain whilst we communicate with Shiro-4, a new and forgettable middleman.<br></p>
