The voice-work from the entire main cast is the best it has been in the entire Walking Dead gaming series. The way conversations can carry such tangible tension is a huge point in the game&#039;s favour as well as that of the sound design team.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guns sound a lot more realistic this time around, causing me to jump at least once when a round was fired unexpectedly. The editing is also a lot better than any Telltale game previously, with each episode title being accompanied by an appropriate theme, immediately setting the tone for what is to come.&lt;/p&gt;
