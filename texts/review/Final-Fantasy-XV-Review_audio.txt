One of the better aspects of the game is the voice acting and soundtrack. From the opening credits, you are drawn in by the melodic "Stand By Me".

The overall soundtrack fits perfectly with the game, with a mixture of both slow and fast paced themes. <br><br>Credit is due to voice actor, Darin de Paul, who plays Ardyn Izunia.
