&lt;i&gt;88 Heroes&lt;/i&gt; puts forward a damn solid platforming experience, especially when you consider that all levels can be completed with all heroes if you&#039;re up for the challenge. It&#039;s funny, frantic and filled with nods to pop culture references that really do hit you in the retro feels. There are some lingering questions regarding longevity, but definitely deserves to be given a chance in your catalogue. One recommendation: get it on something other than the Switch for ~$50 AUD cheaper.
