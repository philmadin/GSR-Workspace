Ripping the base elements from <i>Dark Souls</i> combat, upgrade and enemy design allows <i>Salt and Sanctuary</i> to stand up solidly as a piece of software. Fighting enemies is fairly basic however missing opportunities to strike and failing to anticipate an enemies next move can cause your death fairly quickly.&nbsp;<p>However, there is a deep complicated method to creating difficulty in a video game and even <i>Dark Souls</i> misses the mark at times. <i>Salt and Sanctuary </i>succeeds for the most part in creating popcorn fights that are challenging without being obnoxious. When it comes to harder fights, there isn’t a desire to teach you how to play.&nbsp;</p><p>Dying to a difficult enemy should show me that I need to improve my own ability with the game, that this enemy is susceptible to certain attacks and that exploiting its weaknesses is key to victory. <i>Salt and Sanctuary</i> focuses too hard on bludgeoning you to death and hoping you survive. This does lead to some tension filled combat, however the feeling of success, the feeling of becoming a better player is lost to a sigh of relief and simply continuing on.&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">The weapon upgrade system is almost identical to <i style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Dark Souls</i>, without much sign of attempting to mask it. Think lawsuit material. The character level up system is a mess. Beginning your game allows you to pick a class which is great, but the method to improve that avenue of combat you desire is through a skill tree. This skill tree flows like the roots of a great tree, but it’s unfocused and attempting to do for you what <i style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Dark Souls</i> lets you do naturally. Instead of equipment weight being effected by say, Endurance, you have to select more Endurance like you would a talent in <i style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Ori and the Blind Forest</i>. This means so much room is taken up by unnecessary talents, clogging up a skill tree that should be leaner.</span><br></p><p></p>
