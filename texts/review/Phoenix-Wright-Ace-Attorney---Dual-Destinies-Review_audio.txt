&lt;p&gt;The music in any &lt;i&gt;Ace Attorney&lt;/i&gt; game is always stand out. It accompanies you wherever you go so it&#039;s almost required. &lt;i&gt;Dual Destinies&lt;/i&gt; is the first in the series to have an orchestrated soundtrack. It helps provides a new feel to the game and the old tracks such as &#039;Apollo Justice- The Start of a New Chapter! 2013&#039; sounds fantastic.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that being said, some may still prefer the style of music in &lt;i&gt;Apollo Justice&lt;/i&gt; or the original trilogy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
