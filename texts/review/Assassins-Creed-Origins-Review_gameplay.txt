&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Assassin&#039;s Creed Origins&lt;/i&gt; is often compared to &lt;i&gt;Far Cry&lt;/i&gt;, and rightfully so. It takes elements such as strongholds, hunting, craftable upgrades, skill trees, and useless loot for some quick cash. But it works so well for this game, which is essentially based on these elements. Throw in some incredibly fun elements to experiment with, such as fire, poison, and Senu the Ubisoft-mandated d?r?o?n?e?&amp;nbsp; eagle, and you&#039;ve got a great base game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then comes everything else. The world is enormous, and the only way to fast travel is to unlock fast travel points with that age-old Synchronize feature. So a lot of time is spent riding horses and camels from one place to another because the automatic path-following is terrible, and slowly losing your motivation to continue playing as you realise how long you&#039;re going to spend finding something to do. As per usual for the franchise, Origins is loaded with enough content to keep a completionist happy until 2020, but this is far more of a problem than usual as there&#039;s no real way to track most of this content. No counters for anything but Sync points, no list of what has been completed, and no hope for anyone to try and 100% the game.&lt;/p&gt;
