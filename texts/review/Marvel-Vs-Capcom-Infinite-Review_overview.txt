2017 continues to be the year of the fighting game, and as such Capcom has decided to take gamers back to their shared fighting universe,&amp;nbsp; with&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Marvel Vs. Capcom: Infinite&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Marvel Vs. Capcom&lt;/i&gt; series is back after a 5-year layoff to take gamers back to a world where they can pursue Captain America with Chris Redfield (and his boulder crushing biceps). &lt;i&gt;Marvel Vs. Capcom: Infinite&lt;/i&gt; is developed and published by Capcom, and is available now on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via Steam. &amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;
