Let me put on my rose-tinted glasses. I liked &lt;i&gt;Yooka-Laylee&lt;/i&gt;. The design of the gameplay and sound made me forget that I was playing on Xbox One and made me feel like I was back in 1998 playing on my Nintendo 64. This game feels like it was made for the fans that wanted a new &lt;i&gt;Banjo-Kazooie&lt;/i&gt; game but didn&#039;t like what Rare were doing with the series. If you are a fan of the old &lt;i&gt;Banjo-Kazooie&lt;/i&gt; games of the late 90&#039;s this game is for you. I score &lt;i&gt;Yooka-Laylee&lt;/i&gt; 8.5 out of 10.&lt;br&gt;
