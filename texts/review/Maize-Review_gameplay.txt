For the most part, this game plays like your typical walking simulator, walking around from place to place performing actions in order to progress the story. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But that is not to say that this game isn&#039;t fun. The walking simulator style mixed with old school 1990&#039;s adventure game mechanics (ala The Curse of Monkey Island) make for a fun few hours filled with bizarre environment puzzles, and a whole heap of exploring to find all of the background storytelling found in the collectables. &lt;br&gt;
