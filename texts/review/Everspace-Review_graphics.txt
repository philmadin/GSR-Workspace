&lt;p&gt;This is one beautiful game. Colours are vibrant and playful, particle and fog effects are realistic, textures are detailed and the backdrops for each star system are just... wow.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Space games can often struggle with depicting orientation, but not &lt;i&gt;Everspace&lt;/i&gt;. Whether in first or third person views, I always knew where I was - and what I needed to do to get to where I needed to be. The depth of field at play is quite simply perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
