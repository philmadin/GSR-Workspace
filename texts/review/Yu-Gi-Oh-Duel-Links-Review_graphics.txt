&lt;p&gt;Because this is a mobile app, the graphics in the game aren&#039;t outstanding but they&#039;re decent. It mostly consists of 2D Sprites but when a character is summoning their signature monster it plays a short 3D cutscene. The sprites are well drawn and show a variety of emotions of the characters and the short cutscenes are neat in the middle of a Duel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to view the battlefield, either top-down which just displays the cards or from an angle, which shows a floating image of the monster above the card.&lt;/p&gt;
