Human Revolution has decent shooting, usable stealth and is generally acceptable though at times it feels as if the developers have taken parts from other games and tried to combine them into a single title. While The Directors Cut certainly improves on a lot of the mechanics, particularly the cover system, it still remains jarring and clunky, most notably during the transition between different gameplay styles. Where the game excels is in the use of augmentations,various cybernetic implants that allow the player to gain a significant advantage over the enemy. From a cloaking field, the ability to break through certain walls to more powerful skills such as the Icarus landing system, the removal of all fall damage, and the typhoon, wherein the player scatters small explosives about themselves, clearing rooms of all opponents. Unfortunately the game is let down by a bad inventory system that is more like a jigsaw puzzle and a backpack and in the dull boss battles. In the original release bosses could be fought only in single combat though The Directors Cut does add more options they still remain limited.Overall the game is adequate, perfectly playable but containing nothing of note outside of the players numerous options.
