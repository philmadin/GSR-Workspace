The gameplay is pretty straightforward, you and up to five friends pick a character, take a silly selfie, then test you trivia skills across a plethora of different topics. The winner at the end of all these quizzes will be the person with the most correct answers. Other than that there are some mini games which will help you separate from the pack and determine who is the trivia master.&lt;br&gt;
