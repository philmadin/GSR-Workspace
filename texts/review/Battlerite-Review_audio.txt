The sounds of the game are quite brilliant. Voice over artists have done a great job giving life to each champion, and the background music is also an effective addition to the gameplay. I&#039;ll have to also admit that some of the character voices and their dialogues are still etched into memory long after my last match in &lt;i&gt;Battlerite&lt;/i&gt;.
