Yakuza Kiwami has a deep and intriguing story, however the start of the game can be long-winded due to the heavy cut-scenes. Once you get past that hurdle, Yakuza Kiwami is insanely engrossing and makes you truly care about all the characters from beginning to end. The character development is superbly done, giving each character a slow build-up until the end of the game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The story follows the series&#039; protagonist Kazuma Kiryu, who takes the fall for the murder of his families&#039; boss and is sent to prison. When Kiryu is released on parole 10 years later, the city of Kamurocho has changed and he must now find his place while trying to uncover the identity of the true murderer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
