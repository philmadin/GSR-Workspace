&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;Providing a modern take on Tetris, the aim of &lt;i style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;Pudi&lt;/i&gt; is to match colours and shapes to beat high scores. You have a 2x2 grid of four dots at the bottom that can be rotated with a swipe, and the top two dots in the grid swappable with a double tap. The goal is simply to match the falling dots with the top two dots in your grid -&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;this, of course, &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;gets harder the longer the game goes on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pudi&lt;/i&gt; is designed for one handed play and feels very tight - games are fast and frantic as you try to get the dots exactly where you want them. Quite often I&#039;ve gotten my swipes and taps mixed up resulting in&amp;nbsp;game&amp;nbsp;over, however with such simple mechanics it never feels unfair. Restarts are only ever a tap away too,&amp;nbsp;meaning you can jump straight back into the action with minimal stuffing around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In standard gamemode you are matching colours,&amp;nbsp;however&amp;nbsp;there is also a colour blind mode that swaps out the dots for shapes. Unfortunately, each shape is still surrounded by an outer circle and doesn&#039;t feel as easy to distinguish as it should be. I was hoping a combination of colour and shape would help my own scores, but I ended up sticking with the standard mode as it was less confusing. That said those who are colour blind may have a different experience.&lt;/p&gt;
