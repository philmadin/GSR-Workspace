<br>English voiceover work is serviceable, but not the best out there. In fact, I found many of the voices to be grating - but thankfully these instances were few and far between.<br><br>Music was very well done, though nothing too memorable. Some tunes are catchy, but nothing to the extent of Yoko Shimimuara's or Nobuo Uematstu's work.<br><br>One thing that bothered me quite a bit, however, was the inconsistency of Rean's dialogue. Cutscenes would randomly decide to switch between having him fully-voiced, and him being a mute represented only with text (whilst others around him still spoke). This was incredibly weird.<br><br>
