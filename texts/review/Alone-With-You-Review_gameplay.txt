<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With no one but yourself to wander the planet, there is no need for weapons and health kits. Instead you walk to and fro in crumbling Environmental Dome’s and Cave systems, searching for whatever items and information are vital to your escape ship’s success. Some puzzles begin to pop up the further you travel, but none present that grand of a challenge, requiring only a keen eye.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Discussions with the Holograms are unlocked after a few trips out to the Planet. After daily missions you are allowed to discuss your findings of the day with the relevant Hologram. Conversation is one sided with long monologues by the Holos, detailing their personal demon’s and daily struggles, whilst your character’s response is more or less “OK.”. The closest interactions to conversation come between the Planet A.I and yourself as you rummage through the rubble.</span></p><p class="p2">Ultimately, interactivity here is lacking. The storyline is key, but there's a lot of wandering around that feels like unnecessary empty space, particularly in those first few days.<br></p>
