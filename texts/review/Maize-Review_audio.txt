The music in &lt;i&gt;Maize&lt;/i&gt; is rather deceivingly used throughout. It sounds creepy and unsettling while you are roaming around the farm attempting to solve the puzzles. Until you get towards the end of the game, at that point things turn more upbeat and very 1980&#039;s.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The voice is delivered really well, in that it injects the right amount of humour, exposition, and intrigue. That is key to helping keep the player engaged in figuring out, just what is happening here?&lt;br&gt;
