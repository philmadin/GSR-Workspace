While Soulstorm itself isn&#039;t all bad, it does very little to change up the formula, instead creating a larger, longer, more boring campaign. The new races and characters really aren&#039;t that interesting, especially the laughable Indrick Boreale, who has since become a joke of the series. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not bad but not great either.
