Video games and underwater gameplay never seem to mesh well. Finding that balance between manoeuvrability and effect of being underwater has been ever elusive. <i>Song of the Deep’s</i> desire to focus on exploration and discovery over combat and fast paced battles are what allow it to work.<p><br></p><p>Guiding your submarine through ancient underwater cities and wreckages is smooth, responsive and engaging; whilst combat is peppered throughout as more of a roadblock than any sort of challenge. Your craft can also be upgraded by collecting treasure and coins that are exchangeable with a friendly hermit crab for upgrades to your vessel.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Most serve as tools to aid in your travels instead of simple weapon enhancements. Eventually, Merryn can even leave her Sub, clad in a new wetsuit, and explore tighter spaces than she could before.What starts to hurt the experience is the lack of variety and tedium.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Despite being enjoyable, floating through the deep in your submarine and discovering all the little treasures and puzzles, there’s not much more. The story gets lost in the exploration and the exploration gets lost in the lack of drive to really do anything. There’s no real threats to Merryn and nothing truly spectacular to discover outside of an old wreck.</p>
