Javier is our new protagonist. An ex-baseball player who threw away all of his athletic potential and familial ties due to an intense gambling addiction. The characterisation of our new playable character is impeccable. We immediately identify with him and his individual apocalyptic struggle. He is the de facto patriarch of his survivor group which features his nephew, niece and brothers wife.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is set several years after Season 2 and reveals to us a new enemy, aptly titled &lt;i&gt;The New Frontier&lt;/i&gt;. A group of bad guys who do evil things, nothing to really differentiate them from the monsters we&#039;ve already seen in previous seasons. There are some returning characters, including an older more jaded Clementine as well as some really interesting portrayals of loyalty and strained family bonds. This is without a doubt the most captivating story told in this universe since season 1.&lt;/p&gt;
