Despite being a multiplayer-focused game, &lt;i&gt;Splatoon 2&lt;/i&gt; does have a chunky single player Hero Mode - and it&#039;s quite bigger than the original.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set over 32 levels in five different zones, the basic plot has your custom inkling working for a secret Squid organisation that is at covert war with the Octarians. Christened &#039;Agent 4&#039;, you work with familiar characters such as popstar-cum-agent Marie and the weapons-obsessed Sheldon, as you try to track down the missing Callie, whilst rescuing the kidnapped Great Zapfish. It&#039;s typically lighthearted stuff from Nintendo, with a great amount of puntastic dialogue, and extra tidbits of lore found in scrolls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Otherwise, what little plot there is remaining is found in the new Salmon Run mode. Working for Grizzco, you need to pas a couple of tutorials, before venturing out in this twisted take on the traditional horde mode, as you look for precious Golden Eggs, and obliterate the Salmonoids.&lt;br&gt;
