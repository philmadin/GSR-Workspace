<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: start;">The gameplay is where Quadrilateral Cowboy shines. While confusing at first the game slowly begins giving the player tips on how to use their equipment through environmental clues such as warning labels on alarmed doors and buttons only accessible through small gaps.</p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: start;"><br></p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: start;"><br></p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: start;">The tools which you have to use are varied and interesting, each with their own specific purpose and mechanics. Your main tool is the deck, a portable hacking platform that unfolds itself from it's briefcase disguise. The deck it used to access doors, grates and laser grids as well as controlling your other tools, all through what amounts to very basic coding.</p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: start;"><br></p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: start;"><br></p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: start;">Yes, you read that right, coding. When you need to open a door you toss the deck on a nearby surface, type in, door(x), x being the door number, .open(3) and the door will open for 3 seconds, or however long you tell it to open for. Eventually you'll be able to string code together to open doors, disable camera and unlock air vents all in a perfectly timed sequence.</p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: start;"><br></p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: start;"><br></p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: start;">The other tool that sees a lot of use is the Weevil, a small, four legged soup can with a camera. You can guide it through small spaces using it's own code system, tell it how far to move, where and when to turn as well as hooking it up to datajacks to open doors which you are patiently waiting on the other side of. Of course you also have a mini CCTV setup which allows you to see what the Weevil sees creating some great moments.</p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: start;"><br></p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: start;"><br></p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: start;">Quadrilateral Cowboy has not only some of the most interesting gameplay I've ever experienced but also features some of the most unique puzzles that require careful thought and planning. Nothing quite feels like the moment you hook up the Weevil to your cybernetic eye blinks so that it opens a door while your aimbot turret turns off the laser grid as you run through silently. Each time you succeed it feels rewarding and even your failures won't discourage you.</p>
