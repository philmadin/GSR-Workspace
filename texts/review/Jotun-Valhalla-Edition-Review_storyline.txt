<br>Since the game is only three to four hours long, the plot for <i>Jotun</i> is fairly simple. After dying during a battle at sea, Viking Thora slowly sink to the bottom of the ocean. However, she is given a chance at entering Valhalla, but she must journey through the Nordic underworld, and battle the gods of the various realms.<br><br>In between chapters, Thora will offer some exposition regarding her life, and how she became a warrior. It's nothing too deep, but I nevertheless greatly enjoyed the developer's method of telling the story through gameplay, rather than cutscenes. <br>
