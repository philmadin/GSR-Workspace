Ultimately, your purchase of &lt;i&gt;StarCraft Remastered &lt;/i&gt;comes down to one thing. Can you justify spending $20AUD on a twenty-year-old game for what amounts to higher resolutions and a visual upgrade, not an overhaul. If you were never a fan of the original game, this won&#039;t change your mind. If you&#039;re after &lt;i style=&quot;white-space: normal;&quot;&gt;StarCraft&lt;/i&gt; with modern mechanics, look to the sequel. But if you enjoy the original so much that you don&#039;t mind dropping the money, well, the original is free but it really does look awful.
