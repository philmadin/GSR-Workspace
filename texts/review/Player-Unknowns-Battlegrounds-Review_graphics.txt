Now I&#039;m not going to say that this is a gorgeous game by any means. The best example I can give you is that graphically &lt;i&gt;PUBG&lt;/i&gt; is like cutting fabric with a pair of children&#039;s craft scissors; sure it will get the job done but by no means will it look pretty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With that being said about the world itself, the game is the complete opposite when it comes to the art and design of the guns, ammunition, and clothing. Almost photorealistic in all areas (except the maps themselves)&lt;i&gt; PUBG&lt;/i&gt; has shown that it is ahead of the all the competition in the bland shooter genre. &lt;br&gt;
