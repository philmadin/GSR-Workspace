Both voice acting and the musical score are highly polished in each game. While the dialogue can be cheesy, each character stands out on their own, with great performances from their respective actors. The soundtrack is memorable and invokes feelings of hope and adventure with the underlying threat of danger. The quality of music and voice acting in each game is superb. <br />
