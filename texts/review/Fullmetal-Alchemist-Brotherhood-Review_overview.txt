&lt;i&gt;Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood&lt;/i&gt; is one of those anime that everyone must watch. It&#039;s a classic with an intense plot, memorable characters, and mesmerising music. After the completion of the manga in June 2010, &lt;i&gt;Brotherhood&lt;/i&gt; was made as a straight adaption of the manga.&amp;nbsp;
