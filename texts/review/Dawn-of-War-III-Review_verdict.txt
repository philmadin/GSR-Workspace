&lt;i&gt;Dawn of War 3&lt;/i&gt; feels somewhat unfinished. It&#039;s enjoyable when it works, and mostly fun even when it doesn&#039;t. There&#039;s a lengthy campaign and a solid multiplayer mode. If you need that Warhammer fix now, you&#039;ll probably get your moneys worth. But if you wait you&#039;ll probably get an even better deal as additional content is inevitably released.
