Aven Colony&#039;s graphics are limited by the type of game that it is, but it does everything that it sets out to&amp;nbsp;do. The buildings look great, and the detail in the world was amazing in my opinion considering that most city builder games don&#039;t bother with how the world looks, instead focussing on the buildings themselves. The only fallback of Aven Colony is that when using the 8x speed, the frame rate will drop. For me, this occurred while my colony was at 1000 colonists, but it resolved itself within seconds.&lt;br&gt;
