&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;Imagine a cube. Six sides, six rotational axis. Now imagine being able to traverse said cube at high speed, flipping seamlessly from side to side. Now imagine a complex maze like structure made of said cubes. Walls, towers and bridges with a scattering of enemies. Now imagine the same movement but within said maze and you might get an idea of what it&#039;s like to play Dystoria. It&#039;s difficult to describe but once you&#039;ve experienced it you&#039;ll never look back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;Much like the classic shooters of the past there&#039;s a heavy reliance on projectile avoidance as well as leading shots and learning enemy patterns. If your proficient in games such as Doom or Quake, Dystoria&#039;s combat will come naturally.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;There&#039;s ships to unlock, some of which are obviously inspired by a certain sci-fi film, along with numerous weapons. These are gained by collecting nucleons and the remains of your enemies. There&#039;s also a secret ship that can be obtained only though the gathering of individual components scattered throughout the level.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
