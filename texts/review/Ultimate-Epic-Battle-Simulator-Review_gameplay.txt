Gameplay is pretty basic. Choose how many soldiers you want on the battlefield, where they start and who they are. Then hit start and watch. You can zoom about with an aerial camera, fly through the ranks of warriors and, if you so desire, control a single soldier.&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking control of a unit is fun while it lasts, but it never lasts very long, nor is it very fun on account of poor controls. There&#039;s also &quot;God Powers&quot; such as nuclear weapons and powerful winds. These add a little fun but aren&#039;t overly exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
