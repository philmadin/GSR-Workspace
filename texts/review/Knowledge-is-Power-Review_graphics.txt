There isn&#039;t really much to say about what you see of the game, the art style of &lt;i&gt;Knowledge is Power&lt;/i&gt; is very vibrant and cartoony. The colours all really pop and all of the characters and environments are uniquely designed, which gives each stage a fun feeling which really adds to the fun of the game.&lt;br&gt;
