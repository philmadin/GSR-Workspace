Of course, any &lt;i&gt;Metroid&lt;/i&gt; fan knows that gameplay is king in this franchise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Birthing the popular &#039;Metroidvania&#039; genre, Nintendo&#039;s classic franchise is all about exploring labyrinthine environments, blasting dangerous creatures, and acquiring weapons and items that further open up the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unique to &lt;i&gt;Metroid II&lt;/i&gt; was the Metroid hunting mechanic, and it returns here. Basically, the game requires you hunt down 37 of the dangerous aliens, which are scattered all over the world. You need to defeat the required amount before progressing to the next area, and the buggers come in three types - Alpha, Gamma and Zeta.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite being a remaster, &lt;i&gt;Samus Returns&lt;/i&gt; also introduces some new mechanics. Samus can use a new melee counter attack, which is done by pressing X at the right time. The time frame for this move is fairly generous, and successfully doing it opens your foe for a devastating blast. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also new are Aeion abilities, which are special moves that allow our favourite bounty hunter to perform such feats like creating a shield, scanning the environment for secret routes, and unleash rapid-fire blasts. These drain your Aeion meter, which can be refilled by killing enemies and finding special caches.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Along with teleports that allow you to backtrack more easily, the rest of the game is textbook &lt;i&gt;Metroid&lt;/i&gt;. Varia Suits. Ice Beams. Morph Balls. Grapple Beams. Its all here, and is as satisfying as ever. The whole game feels very good to play, and MercurySteam has done a superb job in capturing the feel of the series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, Amiibo are used here too. Using the new Samus figure blesses you with an extra energy tank and a refill of Aeion, whilst the delightfully squishy Metroid model reveals the location of the closest of his kin. The &lt;i&gt;Smash Bros.&lt;/i&gt; Samus figures also unlock energy and missiles - and completing the game itself nets you the Fusion Mode (a harder mode and a new suit), and an art gallery.&lt;br&gt;
