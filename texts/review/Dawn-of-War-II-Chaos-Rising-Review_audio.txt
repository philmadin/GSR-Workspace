Chaos Rising has some great new audio. There are unit callouts for when fighting Chaos and Chaos themselves range from uttering praises to the dark gods to laughing manically, cackling as they cut through enemies. The demons growl and gurgle with all the repulsive monstrosity one would expect. All up, it&#039;s pretty great.
