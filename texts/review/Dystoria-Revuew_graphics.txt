Built in the Unity Engine, Dystoria is hardly stunning. What it is, is cool. There&#039;s neon lights everywhere, so much so that it&#039;s difficult not to compare to Tron. Even the ships have neon coatings. The look interesting enough though they hardly inspired but they are distinct which makes combat a lot easier. Overall, nothing too impressive but nothing bad either.
