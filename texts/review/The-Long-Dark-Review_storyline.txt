The story is told in an episodic format. While this is still being developed (as of writing),&amp;nbsp;there are currently two episodes of the &lt;i&gt;Wintermute&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;story with the other three still to come.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wintermute&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;is an amazingly engaging story, which takes you on an emotional journey. You play as Will Mackenzie, a bush pilot who is flying deep into the Canadian North when a global disaster, simply known as The &quot;quiet apocalypse&quot;, causes the plane to crash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the story of &lt;i&gt;Wintermute &lt;/i&gt;develops, Will learns about the land he has found himself in, and what happened to&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;the people left&amp;nbsp;abruptly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
