Firing weapons, both with suppressors and without are the crispest, most delightful audio outputs in the game. Kudos Ubisoft &amp;amp; Massive Entertainment, kudos. Another huge plus is that the Ghosts will often have random conversations to stimulate the storyline. The whistling of birds and weather combinations are now standard for most open-world games, so there&#039;s nothing that stands out there.
