In my honest opinion, Rugby League Live 4 is a good game, but by no means is it a great game. The career mode is deeper than most sports games, in that it takes you from an 18-year-old rookie to the top of your preferred league. But the gameplay and graphics are where this game really falls down. If&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;the game spent longer in &lt;/span&gt;development,&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt; it could have been great.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the audio sounds better than most, I believe that this game is only really for the biggest rugby league fans that can look past the game&#039;s look and weird controls to find the fun behind it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rugby League Live 4 is a game that has obviously been rushed to market and not given the time to be properly developed to give the Rugby League Live series fans the game they deserve.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
