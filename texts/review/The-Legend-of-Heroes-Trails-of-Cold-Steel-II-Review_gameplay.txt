<br>Though the narrative is complex and intricate, it's the gameplay of <i>Trails of Cold Steel II</i> that arguably steals the show.<br><br>As you'd probably expect, combat is a turn-based affair, but with a sprinkling of real-time movement. With a party of three, you encounter enemies on the field, and enter fights by slashing them, which allows for preemptive strikes. Things then move to a small arena, allowing you to use physical attacks, magic, items, etc. Mixing things up is the need to move into the right positions in order to perform moves, as well as the 'Tactical Link System', which allows characters to pull off special finishing moves and combinations that can be leveled-up. Also integral to combat is the 'Quartz' system, which are gems that can be collected and equipped, enabling you to customise your crew.<br><br>I was incredibly impressed by the exploration and world-building aspect of the game. Reminding me of <i>Xenoblade Chronicles</i> (high praise indeed!), environments are large (albeit not <i>quite</i> as open) and chock full of things to see and do. NPC quests are plentiful, and there are innumerable side activities, like fishing (of course), cooking and an extensive friendship-building system. Everything is executed incredibly smoothly, with virtually no complaints being raised during my playthrough - an amazing achievement for a small development studio!<br><br>Also nice is cross-save compatibility between both PS3 and Vita versions, extensive extras for those with a save file from the previous game, and continued support in the form of free DLC. This is definitely an extensive package well worth your money!<br><br>
