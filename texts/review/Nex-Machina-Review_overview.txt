The shoot &#039;em up - a genre almost as old as videogames themselves - is a staple part of action games. Classics like &lt;i&gt;Ikaruga&lt;/i&gt; and more recent entries like &lt;i&gt;Enter the Gungeon&lt;/i&gt; have helped to define the genre; but one in particular stood out, &lt;i&gt;Resogun&lt;/i&gt;, a Playstation exclusive that quickly became one of the highest rated games one the system. It was successful for three reasons. Smooth controls, clean visuals and a clear sense of purpose. Unfortunately &lt;i&gt;Nex Machina&lt;/i&gt;, developed by the same team, has none of these things.
