<br>This title first came to mobile in 2013 and the graphics reflect this. However, despite looking its age <i>Oceanhorn</i> still presents a charming visual style. It's reminiscent of early <i>Zelda</i> experiences as well as many other Nintendo exclusives.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">The colours are vibrant and each island looks notably different. The character models don't share this uniqueness however and they regrettably all look much too similar. Hopefully in the sequel the characters receive as much attention as the locations they inhabit.&nbsp;</span>
