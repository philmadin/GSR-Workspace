The gameplay is based on stringing together different combinations of moves that Velvet either unlocks through levelling up or already has available to her in her base skillset. It is pretty simple to learn despite an influx of confusing menu pop ups but on normal difficulties, players should have no trouble mastering the fundamentals.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there is enough nuance to provide a worthy challenge. Some of the characters super abilities are spectacular when unleashed and even basic combinations look like well-choreographed anime fight scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
