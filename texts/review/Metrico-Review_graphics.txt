There is indeed diversity too, in that across the different sections of the game one will find themselves in a starkly varied worlds of black and white one moment and then in what would be best described as a neon sign the next. They don’t really link however, there’s nonsensical reasoning to the changes between worlds resulting in more of an art gallery, observing the odd designs then leaving them behind.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are long periods, especially at the start of simply a blank screen. Progression brings change to the environment with rising and falling scenery in the background, but it’s a fairly bland beginning. The starker, colourful changes come further in and whilst the game is quite short, it doesn’t exactly grab ones attention for a fair while.</span></p>
