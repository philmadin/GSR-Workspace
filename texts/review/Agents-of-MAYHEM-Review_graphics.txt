The characters are superbly designed, brimming with their own personalities and unique back stories that help give the game a deeper lore for fans to delve into. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The overall look of &lt;i&gt;Agents of MAYHEM &lt;/i&gt;is amazing and is what fans have come to expect from Volition, but (and this is a big but),&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Agents of MAYHEM&lt;/i&gt; is a game that is struggling to find its identity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The biggest takeaway from this game is that there was obviously a battle within Volition between those who wanted to make another &lt;i&gt;Saints Row &lt;/i&gt;game, and those who wanted to establish some new IP and move on from &lt;i&gt;Saints Row&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
