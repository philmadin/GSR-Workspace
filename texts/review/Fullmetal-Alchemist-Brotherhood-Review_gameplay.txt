&lt;p&gt;The animation in the series is produced by Bones. The movement is smooth, especially during the fight scenes. There&#039;s a lot of blood and gory imagery within the series and it&#039;s easy to feel the damage as the characters hit and slash at each other.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The background is also something to note as well. It&#039;s done a beautiful painted style that blends in with the environment. The elements and background look beautiful, especially at the mountains in the north at Briggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
