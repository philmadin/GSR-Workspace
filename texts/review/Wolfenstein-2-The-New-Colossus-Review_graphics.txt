My god, this is a beautifully detailed and gory game. For the most part, first-person shooters seem to all look the same (grey, boring, and uninspired with a bland colour palette).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus&lt;/i&gt; breaks that mould&amp;nbsp;because this is a game which has put great emphasis on unique character design, and creating vibrant environments which feel as though they are full of life and brimming with exploration to be had throughout.&lt;br&gt;
