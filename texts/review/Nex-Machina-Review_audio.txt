While the audio is far better than the visuals and the gameplay, it might just be the most boring, contrived audio I&#039;ve ever heard. It sounds like it has been churned out by a machine with the dial set to &#039;80s and while it isn&#039;t bad, it&#039;s just generic. Imagine a game made with nothing but royalty free audio and you&#039;ll start to get the idea.
