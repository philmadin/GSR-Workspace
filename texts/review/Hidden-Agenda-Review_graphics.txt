Graphically, this game is gorgeous, and carries over the realistic style that Supermassive Games has become known for. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aside from some glitches in one of the cut-scenes, this game is flawless, the game sets a creepy noire tone and does a really good job of making the player fear every step they take towards uncovering the mysteries of the Trapper case.&lt;br&gt;
