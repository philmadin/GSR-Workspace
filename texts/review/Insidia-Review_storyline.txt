The beta stage doesn&#039;t give out much information about the storyline or even an introductory video. But here is a glimpse of the story from the game&#039;s website in my own words:&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;400 years have passed since civilization ended. The hardened survivors of this barren desert must join forces to combine their strengths, shield each other&#039;s weaknesses and strategise against those who would stand in their way to the future (I still don&#039;t know what the future or ultimate goal here is. Hopefully they have a strong storyline when the game is complete).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
