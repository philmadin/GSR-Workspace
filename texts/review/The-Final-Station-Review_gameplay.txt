<br>At it's heart, <i>The Final Station </i>is a 2D, side scrolling adventure whose mechanics, while nothing special, are highly polished and control tightly. The game is split between to areas, the train and the stations/cities, each offering their own challenges and rewards.<br><br><br>While on the train the player must ensure that each system is running quickly by engaging in simple minigames. They must also ensure the health of their passengers by providing them with food and medkits which are found outside. You can listen to the passengers conversations and occasionally speak with other conductors.<br><br><br>The stations and cities are where the bulk of the game is played. Your purpose in each area is to kind the code that will release your train from the station. As you search you'll encounter various survivors, come across numerous supplies and encounter the strange creatures that most of humanity has become. <br><br><br>There are six variations of mutant, each with their own attacks and different ways to defeat them. You are given a pistol, a shotgun and a rifle, each of which require the scarce ammunition scattered about the levels.<br><br><br>As a whole <i>The Final Station</i> is enjoyable to play though it suffers from a lack of instruction. It wasn't until toward the end of the game that I discovered the ability to craft resources from the random objects I had been collecting which, if I had of known earlier, would have had a greater impact on the experience. But, despite this minor short coming, it is certainly enjoyable to play.<br>
