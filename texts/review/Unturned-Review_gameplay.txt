If you&#039;ve played any other survival game, you&#039;ll mostly know what to expect. To survive you must find weapons, food and drink, storage and, in certain environments, warmth. But it doesn&#039;t end there. Within Unturned the ability to establish yourself as a true dweller of the wasteland is a very real possibility. You can plant a seed, cultivating the land to ensure a near constant supply of food. Building makeshift defences within what were once centres of population can lead to great rewards, but with a high risk. Or you can simply wander, making your way from place to place, taking only what you need to survive.&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One may take the role of a cop, monitoring the survivors, trying to maintain order through fair ruling. Others may take a more iron-fisted approach to ensuring order, holding a server in an icy grip of terror. And then there are heroes. Ordinary people who have taken up a heavy burden, to slay those who exist only to enforce suffering upon others. These heroes are often praised, rarely seen but always present. But all too often does a hero become corrupted by the power they have, turning against their fellow man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throw in planes, cars, tanks and boats and you have a recipe for disaster - or for order, depending on who&#039;s playing. Servers may split into warring factions or work together to help newer players. Provided you can survive long enough you may one day be well known within the servers you play.&lt;/p&gt;
