To put simply, the presentation is amazing. Using the proprietary Fox Engine, Phantom Pain looks glorious. On PS4 and Xbox One, it runs at 60 fps (1080p for the former, 900p for the latter), and even the last-gen versions are impressive (they are exactly the same, only at 720p and 30 fps). Of course, the PC version is the best of the lot, and it only requires relatively modest specs.
