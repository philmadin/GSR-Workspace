The plot of Dark Crusade is mostly lore and doesn&#039;t follow the standards set by the prior releases. There are seven races, any of which you can play in the campaign.&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You choose the battleground and get faction specific dialogue and the start and finish of each. Each factions stronghold is accompanied by a cinematic when it is attacked; these serve to build character and establish a setting, but there isn&#039;t a whole lot more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it does introduce characters that would become prevalent in the sequel, that&#039;s about all that it offers.&lt;/p&gt;
