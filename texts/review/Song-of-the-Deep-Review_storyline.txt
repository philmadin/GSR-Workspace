For years, Merryn’s father has told tales of his adventures on the sea. So when one day her father does not return from his voyage, Merryn makes it her mission to construct her own submarine and find him. As Merryn unravels the mystery to her dad’s disappearance, she begins to discover just how real his tales of monsters and ancient underwater cities really are.<p><br></p><p>Guided by the gentle Irish voice of the narrator, <i>Song of the Deep</i> presents its tale in short sketched slides as well as voice over during travels. The plot is soft and appealing at first, but after travelling for so long in the same areas, the draw to learn what comes next becomes tiring. Often at times I forgot the entire point of the storyline, only remembering when a mysterious glove was found that possibly belonged to Merryn’s father.</p>
