Gone is the nameless force commander. Now in his place is Apollo Diomedes, a minor character introduced in &lt;i&gt;Chaos Rising&lt;/i&gt;. Diomedes has taken it upon himself to prove his chapters innocence following the events of the past 10 years. If he cannot do so then he himself must seek out and destroy the heresy running deep within the sector. That&#039;s the canon story at least.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Retribution&lt;/i&gt; introduces a new campaign setup wherein you can play as any race, including the newly introduced Imperial Guard, and experience mostly the same missions (albeit with differing cutscenes). Why Relic took this path instead of continuing the more story focused campaign of &lt;i&gt;Chaos Rising&lt;/i&gt; is beyond me. Basically, outside of the cutscenes themselves and a couple of neat throwbacks to prior games, the campaign for &lt;i&gt;Retribution&lt;/i&gt; feels like an afterthought.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
