The darkness has returned to the village of Kamiki, so once more it&#039;s protector Amaterasu must come back to set the world straight and dispel all evil from the land. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Okami HD is a remaster of possibly the best looking game of the PS2 era. Developed by the now-defunct Clover Studios and published by Capcom, &lt;i&gt;Okami HD&lt;/i&gt; is now available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, and PC.&lt;br&gt;
