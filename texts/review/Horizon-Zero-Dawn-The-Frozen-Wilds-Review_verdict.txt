This doesn&#039;t feel like your typical DLC, this game has its own look and feel that is completely its own. Everything from the dialogue to the Machine design has been reworked to make the player think that this is something that is new and fresh for them to sink their teeth into.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In my opinion, this could have been its own standalone expansion or sequel, because that is how this game is presented and truly feels like fans got an early sequel to quell their hunger for another entry into this young yet amazing series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Review Copy provided by Sony Interactive Entertainment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
