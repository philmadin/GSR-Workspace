The music throughout the game sets a soothing and serene mood through its use of traditional Japanese folk music, which encourages the player to explore the artistically designed world. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &quot;dialogue&quot; (which sounds like they have been taken straight from the Banjo Kazooie games) is a mix of grunts and moans. Although humourous at first, it gets rather tiresome after you have to sit through the lengthy Japanese style exposition dumps which plague the early parts of the game.&lt;br&gt;
