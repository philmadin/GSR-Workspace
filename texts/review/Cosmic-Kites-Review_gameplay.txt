&lt;i&gt;Cosmic Kites&lt;/i&gt; has two basic play modes. A local multiplayer mode that lets you and your friends share the same keyboard, or add controllers to play against each other. And a single player mode that is pretty much self-explanatory.&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each time you play you gain experience, increasing your level and unlocking new powers, avatars and obstacles. The controls are very easy, with just 3 buttons that you need to remember. But this doesn&#039;t mean that mastering movement of your spirit animal will be a walk in the park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to your basic left and right turn, you have the ability to teleport short distances occasionally. When timed correctly, the teleport can save your spirit animal from getting destroyed in even the direst of situations. But it can also spell disaster in relatively safe situations if your timing is off.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, if you just want to get to a power-up quickly and decide to teleport there. This time however, you don&#039;t notice that a huge spinning spiky circle is about to spawn in between you and the power up, with teleporting leading your spirit animal right into the circle and certain death.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, mastering the controls can be a bit tricky and at times, annoying. But that&#039;s all part of the challenge. The game gets even more challenging when it&#039;s played in local multiplayer mode, with either your friends or just AI bots. In terms of gameplay, there&#039;s not much room for improvement as it&#039;s pretty much on point. The game is a good improvement on Snake, without adding anything substantially different.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
