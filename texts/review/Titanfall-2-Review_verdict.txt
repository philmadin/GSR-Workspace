Titanfall 2 is not the greatest shooter you can find on the shelf but it is without a doubt one of the most improved sequels in recent memory. From refined multiplayer to a charming single player inclusion, Titanfall 2 is a perfect example of a developer listening to criticism and building stronger foundations accordingly. Hopefully Titanfall 2 starts to receive the commercial success it deserves because at its current bargain price, it is indeed a worthy addition to any gamer's FPS library.Â
