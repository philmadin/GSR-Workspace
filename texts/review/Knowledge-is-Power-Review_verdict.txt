Much like all of the PlayLink games that I have played so far, &lt;i&gt;Knowledge is Power&lt;/i&gt; is an absolute riot to play with friends. It tests your trivia skills as well as who among your friends is the most cruel and desperate to win, which makes for a fun evening of laughs and side glances for all involved.&lt;br&gt;
