&lt;i&gt;Matterfall&lt;/i&gt; does promise some fun. Focusing on highscores and killing enemies with a high combo can be satisfying. It is difficult though, to ignore the long load times, sloppy gameplay and overall shortness of the missions. Great game if you need a break from everything else.&lt;br&gt;
