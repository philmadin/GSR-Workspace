It&#039;s the 19th century, and you are Devan Rensburg - a mixed-heritage man on board the HLV Herald as it sails towards the Eastern Colonies. Working as a steward to pay for your journey; it&#039;s your job to take care of the passengers and crew, and as you do you inadvertently get caught up in their affairs. These are times of great inequality and injustice between race, class and religion, however, so expect your moral compass to be challenged as you navigate these stormy waters.
