<br><i>SUPERHOT</i> is all gameplay and it's all good. It's precise, feels great and every kill is satisfying.<br><br>The main mechanic of the game is that time only moves when you do, or, time is really slow until you move. This gives you the time to line up shots, dodge bullets and steal weapons. There is a good variety of weapons, from fists to shotguns to katanas, each performing differently.<br><br>Shotguns spray out numerous pellets, katanas slice through enemies and the numerous environmental objects and be thrown about the room, to block enemies and even interrupt bullet trajectory.<br><br>The Hotswitch function allows the player to jump between bodies, allowing for some enjoyable strategy and adding more depth.<br><br>Outside of the short campaign there are endless arenas, challenge modes and other, smaller games hidden within the system. <br><br><i>SUPERHOT</i> feels great to play, punching an enemy, stealing their gun, firing at the nearest target, Hotswitching to another and tossing a TV at the red dude whose trying to cut you in half. It all flows together into glorious cacophony of violence like nothing you've played before.<br><br>
