The character designs and overall visuals are quite beautiful. The art style may look a bit similar to that of&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Overwatch &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Dota, &lt;/i&gt;but it is better considered as being inspired by those epic games rather than copying them. &lt;i&gt;Battlerite &lt;/i&gt;still gifts a lot of originality to its champions and gameplay.&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from the design aspects, during gameplay the view of the arena is a top-down perspective. This gives a feel of familiarity to strategy gamers. Controlling the champions with the regular WASD keys from this view is quite different yet satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
