<br>The games begins in a decidedly darker fashion than in previous entries - quite literally! Caught in the midst of a thunderstorm, Princess Peach and Toad arrive at Mario's home in the dead of night, carrying a foreboding message.<br><br><br>However, this is no ordinary message. As he unfolds the seemingly-normal piece of paper, Mario discovers to his horror that what he holds in his gloved hands is a toad, completely drained of its colour!<br><br><br>After a hilarious reaction, the trio discover that the dessicated fungi possesses the delivery stamp of Prism Island, and as such decide to journey to the mysterious land in order to find some answers.<br><br><br>Arriving at the dock of Port Pisma, Mario finds the entire town deserted, before coming across the disturbing scene&nbsp; of Toad being sucked of his colour by a straw-wielding Shy Guy. After belting the red fiend and his pals, the portly plumber then befriends Huey (get it?), a floating, talking paint can who tells him that Prism Island is having its beautiful shades erased by a nefarious force. As such, the sarcastic tin travels with Mario across the island in order to find some answers, as well as reviving the world's Big Paint Stars.<br><br><br>In true <i>Paper Mario</i> fashion, the story is simply excellent. With a wide variety of locales and amusing scenarios, I truly had a righteous time going through the campaign. Whether it's coffee shops full of hipster Shy Guys, the Power Rangers-esque Toad Rescue Squad, or that ever pesky green mustache guy, the characters are hilariously written, with lines that made me legitimately laugh out loud. I give <i>major</i> kudos to the Treehouse Localisation team for conveying the wit and sharp dialogue of the original Japanese script. <br>
