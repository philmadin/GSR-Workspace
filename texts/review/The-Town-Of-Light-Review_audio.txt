While the music for &lt;i&gt;The Town of Light&lt;/i&gt; can be theatrical and emotional, it only appears in bits and pieces. The game lacks atmosphere with hardly any background noise or music with only Renee&#039;s footsteps to keep you company. The noises you do hear sound hollow and fake. The emphasis seems to be on heightening key scenes rather than the game a whole.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
