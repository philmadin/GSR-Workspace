&lt;i&gt;DiRT 4&lt;/i&gt; is beautiful, I don&#039;t think I can put it any other way. The graphics and attention to details so small that the everyday player wouldn&#039;t notice are amazing. Codemasters have shown that the recreation of every country&#039;s roads matters to them, and they want to make sure that they get as much right as they possibly can.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;DiRT 4&lt;/i&gt; doesn&#039;t only have great attention to detail when it comes to road signs; Codemasters have also put an amazing amount of effort into the design of cars and environments. Tracks and surrounding environments react to the movements you make during the race, giving a smooth and responsive ride. Throughout all my hours of playing, I didn&#039;t come across any graphical glitches.&lt;br&gt;
