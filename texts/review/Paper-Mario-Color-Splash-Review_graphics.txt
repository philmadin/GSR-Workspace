<br>In typical Nintendo fashion, the graphics for <i>Paper Mario: Colour Splash</i> are bright, bold and beautiful.<br><br><br>Initially, I didn't think HD would add very much to the handcrafted aesthetic, but boy, was I wrong! Immediately, the power of the Wii U is used with maximum effectiveness, with crinkled cardboard scenery mixing with objects that look as though they were put together with scissors and glue. Combine this with liberal use of bloom (a holdover from the similarly stunning <i>Super Mario 3D World</i>), and <i>Color Splash</i> is truly a feast for the eyes! Small presentation touches like enemy health being represented by their colour richness, and witty dialogue mocking the player as they pick their battle cards really adds personality to the whole thing.<br><br><br>If I had any qualms, I would say that it was slightly disappointing seeing a relatively small amount of unique character models, with Toads and Shy Guys being the main culprits. Also, Koopa Kids? Again? Come on, Nintendo...<br>
