The story (as always) follows the adventures of Sonic and his friends as they battle against Eggman and his forces, to stop the destruction of life as they know it; only this time Eggman has a mysterious enemy who is more powerful than any other foe they have battled to date.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The story of &lt;i&gt;Sonic Forces &lt;/i&gt;is simply put boring. While there is some effort in creating a new narrative for players to enjoy at the beginning with a new mysterious antagonist, that is very quickly squashed into the typical bland story that is spread across all Sonic games. It is also plagued by predictable story points and a linear progression that makes it just fit into the same old Sonic formula which hasn&#039;t been a hit with fans since the early &#039;90s. &lt;br&gt;
