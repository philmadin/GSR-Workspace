&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Everspace&lt;/i&gt; is a glorious mix of the &#039;94 game &lt;i&gt;Descent&lt;/i&gt;, and the 2012 &lt;i&gt;FTL&lt;/i&gt;. If you haven&#039;t played either, let me break it down for you: you are in a spaceship with freedom of movement in six directions, a healthy armoury of swappable weapons and sub-systems, and an endless selection of enemies and objects to hurl your weapons at. You are making your way through a star system that is randomised on each playthrough, a star system that is constantly testing your ability to stay alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is one expertly crafted arcade shooter. Controls are tight and responsive, resulting in combat that is both fun and satisfying. You will need to make the best use of the assets available to you as you balance offence with defence, weapon use with movement ability, shield vs. hull damage and more, which in turn allows for a great variety of playstyles. There are resources to collect, blueprints to unlock and upgrades to craft, and your ship must be kept fuelled up and repaired if you&#039;re going to have any chance of surviving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nature of roguelikes means that you will die a lot, but this shouldn&#039;t scare you in &lt;i&gt;Everspace&lt;/i&gt;. This is a persistent roguelike, meaning you have the ability to upgrade your pilot and ship after each run. Death is how you progress, and there&#039;s a great risk vs. reward system at play as a result. All unspent credits are lost after each run, meaning you need to push harder if you want those better upgrades.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
