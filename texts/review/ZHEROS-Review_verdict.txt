&lt;i&gt;ZHEROS&lt;/i&gt; is a great attempt at bringing back the 3D side-scrolling beat &#039;em up to a modern next-gen audience and I believe is successful in doing this. &lt;i&gt;ZHEROS&lt;/i&gt; has flaws like all games do but none of it&#039;s flaws make it unplayable. Put &lt;i&gt;ZHEROS&lt;/i&gt; in the hands of children and this game would be a fun example of what games were like back in the beat &#039;em up heyday of the &#039;80s and early &#039;90s.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;
