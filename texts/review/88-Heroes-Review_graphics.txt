&lt;p&gt;Accompanying the retro gameplay is suitably retro graphics. Blocky without being abrasive on your eyes, &lt;i&gt;88 Heroes&lt;/i&gt; is colourful, detailed and full of character.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I don&#039;t get though is the interface - the whole game plays through the view of a bustling security room. Dr. H8 with his control panel and minions overlay everything, and can sometimes get in the way of what&#039;s going on. Sure, it&#039;s charming at first, but let me turn it off!&lt;/p&gt;
