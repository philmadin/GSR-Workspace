Crash games are mainly revered for their unique level design and addictive gameplay, generally not the story. The ongoing plight of Crash, his sister Coco and his nemesis Cortex are never really the driving force behind one&#039;s desire to pick up these games. It is light hearted fun that isn&#039;t intended to be taken too seriously.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is as ridiculous as the 90&#039;s style cartoons of Crash&#039;s time and the tales told will never be as memorable as other Naughty Dog projects. But the cutscenes are humorous and the characters themselves exhibit plenty of heart. The plot of these games are comparable to an energy drink, sure there are better beverages out there but it still serves a purpose; an exciting, adrenaline fueled rampage as an animated maniac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
