<i>The Legend of Zelda</i> is successful for a reason and it’s ice breaker is the gameplay. After nearly a decade of feedback and a new console, Nintendo have implemented some core changes to much improve <i>Twilight Princess</i>. But instead of pushing the gimmicks of the past few years, most changes are for the better.<br><br>The Wii U Gamepad takes over from the clunky Nun-chuck and Truncheon of the Wii. Gyroscopic motions are incorporated for aiming your Slingshot or Bow whilst inventory and map are on your gamepad screen. You can use the Wii U Pro Controller, but this will simply come down to preference.<br><br>Collecting Tears of Light has been reduced by number allowing a smoother puzzle that doesn’t drag on. The Camera is free moving with the use of the right stick. Stamps can be collected that detail some information about the world of Hyrule and Miiverse support is enabled. Hero Mode mirrors the world and enemies become stronger with less chance for you to heal. All features that were either needed, or add to the experience meaningfully.<br><br>The use of Amiibo support is less interesting and useful. You can swipe a Toon Link over the Amiibo space to replenish arrows for example. It’s not necessary and I had trouble even activating the Amiibo abilities themselves.
