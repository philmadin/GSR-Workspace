The game is very straightforward. Players are matched against one another and need to kill the opponents to win. What makes this game a bit different is that players can perform acts called PWN after killing an opponent. A PWN is basically aimed to mock the opponent by dancing after you&#039;ve killed them. PWNing gives the players XP and gold which can be used for customization.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the few good things about this game is the character customization. You can customize the character&#039;s various body parts. You can also customize weapons like increasing clip size and recoil reduction etc.&lt;/p&gt;
