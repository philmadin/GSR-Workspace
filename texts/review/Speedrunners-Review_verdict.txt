&lt;i&gt;Speedrunners &lt;/i&gt;is a fun new take on an old genre. The fast-paced hectic atmosphere that this game has, makes it a joy to play. The music and art style add a different dimension to &lt;i&gt;Speedrunners&lt;/i&gt;, with a colourful design and engaging gameplay. I suggest that everyone picks this game up and plays it for a fun alternative to the current releases. &lt;i&gt;Speedrunners &lt;/i&gt;is free for the month of June through games with gold on Xbox One or through the Xbox store for under $20.&lt;br&gt;
