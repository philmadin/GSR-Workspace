Abandoning the controversial, cinematic approach of &lt;i&gt;Metroid: Other M&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Samus Returns&lt;/i&gt; is very much a return to the series&#039; roots; emphasising gameplay over needless cutscenes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just like the Game Boy original, the game opens with a recap of the first &lt;i&gt;Metroid&lt;/i&gt;, with Samus successfully infiltrating the planet Zebes, as she wipes out the Space Pirate menace, their leader Mother Brain, and the dangerous bio-weapons known as Metroids.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Determined to finish off the Metroid threat once and for all, the Galactic Federation sends Samus to the creatures&#039; home planet of SR388, in order to track down a missing squadron.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For new Metroid gamers used to lavish exposition, the bare story may come as a bit of a shock - but this has always been Metroid&#039;s main appeal. Events unfold via the player&#039;s actions, with everything conveyed visually.&lt;br&gt;
