There’s something to be said for focusing purely on a multiplayer experience. Without the weight of storytelling every mechanic can be given the needed attention for optimal performance. Every character plays a specific role whether it’s healing, dealing high damage or protecting their team. With 21 roles to choose from, the variety is high and you can switch regularly during each match to meet your teams needs.&nbsp;<p><p><br></p><p>As of right now the game works very well. Powers are interesting, simple to use and are readily available even after requiring a recharge. You can choose whoever you want but it is critical that you be aware of your teams progress. Should your team start to slip, you may need to choose a different character to turn the tide. The game even makes suggestions to you as you wait to begin. This leads to an issue though.&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">A large enough portion of players are unaware or ignorant of the games mechanics, simply choosing to play as say, Tracer, the entire game.The only thing Blizzard need to watch for is imbalance, which they no doubt already have eyes on. When matches become stomping grounds for the elite, even with Skill Based Matchmaking in effect, that will require tuning lest people begin to turn away to other games.</span></p></p>
