So &lt;i&gt;Maize&lt;/i&gt; is a game about two government scientists that misread a memo and create sentient corn. The story is a slow starter, with you simply waking up in a corn maze, while some weird shapes run away from you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After this dull introduction, you quickly find that this isn&#039;t your average adventure game. The story plays out like one of the kookier episodes of The X-Files infused with the witty British humour of Monty Python or Red Dwarf. As you can imagine this makes for a hilariously weird journey around a poorly built farm, which is just a facade for a more absurdly constructed research facility.&lt;br&gt;
