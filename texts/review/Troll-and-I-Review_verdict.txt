&lt;i&gt;Troll and I&lt;/i&gt; is an ambitious game, with good intentions, but lacking in many areas. Combat is a chore and the story telling so slow to build, that most players will mentally check out. If this game had been brought out during the last generation of consoles it may have passed muster, but for the current generation, it just doesn&#039;t belong. This would have been a stronger game if the developers had taken the time to smooth out all of the rough edges.&lt;br&gt;
