If you came into &lt;i&gt;Agents of MAYHEM&lt;/i&gt; expecting another &lt;i&gt;Saints Row&lt;/i&gt; game, then surprise! Gameplay is very different compared to the classic &lt;i&gt;Saints Row&lt;/i&gt; Gameplay style. While &lt;i&gt;Agents of MAYHEM&lt;/i&gt; is a single player game, it feels as though it could be a team based shooter that could push &lt;i&gt;Overwatch&lt;/i&gt; for the title it has comfortably owned since its release.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The use of supers and ultimate attacks, which charge while you battle your foes, feels fresh and immensely fun for a single player game.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Agents of MAYHEM&lt;/i&gt; gives the player a choice of 12 very different (and eccentric) characters to choose from, all with their own playstyles, attack, and weaponry to put LEGION in their place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The main letdown of &lt;i&gt;Agents of MAYHEM&lt;/i&gt; is the small open sandbox. The world is restricted and only unlocked through playing the story and the map is often cluttered with a bombardment of same-same side missions which add nothing to the game (aside from the time logged section of the menu). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other than that, the driving mechanics in &lt;i&gt;Agents of MAYHEM&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;are the best seen in a Volition game yet, making driving between missions a treat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
