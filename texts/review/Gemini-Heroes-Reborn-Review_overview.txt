Gemini: Heroes Reborn is the second of two tie-in games for the television show, Heroes Reborn. The player resumes the role of Cassandra, a girl who discovers she is an "EVO" or "evolved human" while trying to find her family and discover her forgotten past. No-one expected, though, that Gemini would not only turn out to be a terrific game, but a step forward in the superhero genre as a whole.
