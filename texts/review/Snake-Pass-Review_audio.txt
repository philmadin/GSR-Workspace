The soundtrack in this game is composed by David Wise, who has worked on other games such as the &lt;i&gt;Donkey Kong Country&lt;/i&gt; series, and more recently &lt;i&gt;Yooka-Laylee&lt;/i&gt;. The soundtrack provides a nice backing for the game and captures the atmosphere of the jungle-themed levels well. It&#039;s very bouncy and each level&#039;s track will have you head-bopping along as you slither your way through to the end.
