Watch out Marvel and DC! The kids of South Park have donned their capes and are ready to fart, mock, and bludgeon their way to a lucrative superhero franchise of their own. Fractured may be in the title but this game is anything but.&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If having a butt joke in the title of the game evokes a slight giggle from you, then buckle up, for this may be the game for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
