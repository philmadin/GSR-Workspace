Perhaps a game focusing on narrative is not intended to be completely hands on, however most of your time consists of reading and clicking on your chosen dialogue. There are stray moments where the player can engage with the game more directly, such as a dating app, however these moments are fleeting.<br />

The dialogue choices themselves are fairly clear and never feel misrepresentative. Games that ask the player to choose what you say can occasionally have vague and misleading options, with a simple inoffensive question being delivered as passive aggressive or as a joke when neither where intended. Through consistent, witty and mostly believable writing both for other characters and Mark himself, you know that your choices wonâ€™t lead you astray.
