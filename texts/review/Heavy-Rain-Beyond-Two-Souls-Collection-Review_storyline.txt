<i>Heavy Rain</i> (HR) follows the lives of several characters who are all intertwined with the murders of the Origami Killer, as well as the capture of Ethan Mars’ son Shaun. The crime narrative is very intriguing and would be truly engrossing… if not for the awkward and sometimes confounding actions of the characters; particularly Ethan Mars and Maddison. <br><br>The former's inability to ask or even accept help is sometimes infuriating and Maddison's constant violent/sexual assaults by men leans too closely to sexualisation, instead of representing something horrible and the potential damage it would cause mentally.<br><br><i>Beyond Two Souls</i> (BTS) on the other hand follows Jodie, a young woman with a paranormal protector, Aiden. Jodie endures years of hardship and personal growth across a timeline that spans many years.<br><br>The biggest boon <i>Beyond Two Souls</i> has is Ellen Page in the role of Jodie, and Willem Dafoe as Nathan Dawkins. Actors with years of talent and a willingness to engage with their roles picks up the slack of what could be a bland story.Instead of going back to the <i>Heavy Rain's</i> multiple character plot, BTS sticks with Jodie and Aiden, allowing us to get to know and empathise deeper than any character from HR. Jumping back and forth across a timeline of Jodie’s experiences is how the narrative progresses and, as far as timeline switches go, it’s handled well. Each scenario feels self contained enough that you can pick out the rough idea of when it takes place, without it feeling confusing and separated from the story as a whole.
