A fantasy tale, &lt;i&gt;Xenoblade Chronicles 2&lt;/i&gt; is set upon the world of Alrest; an endless sea of clouds that are inhabited by titans. These creatures come in all shapes and sizes, with the biggest of them serving as the nations of the world&#039;s people. In the very center of Alrest is Elysium, a massive world tree that supposedly holds the key to the mysteries of humanity&#039;s past... and its future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The main character of the game is Rex, a teenager who makes his living as a salvager; a treasure hunter who lives on his own mobile titan, affectionately called &#039;Gramps&#039;. Taking a lucrative job from the Argentum Trade Guild, Rex teams with a mysterious group called Torna, who require people to haul up an ancient sunken ship. Upon entering said ship, things quickly go awry - and soon, Rex becomes spiritually tied to a mysterious woman named Pyra.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You see, in Alrest, there are special people called &#039;Drivers&#039;, who are able to create sentient beings known as &#039;Blades&#039;. Like Titans, Blades vary wildly in species, and form a life-long bond with their Driver. Blades aid their partners in battle, by providing an energy weapon, as well as numerous elemental magics. However, Rex soon learns that Pyra is a special kind of Blade - one that is being hunted for her power.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As expected from a Monolith Soft game, the plot of &lt;i&gt;Xenoblade Chronicles 2&lt;/i&gt; is incredibly deep, and delves into philosophical themes that ponder the meanings of life, death and religion. I don&#039;t want to spoil too much, but I was gripped from beginning to end, with truly likable characters and numerous twists and turns. &lt;br&gt;
