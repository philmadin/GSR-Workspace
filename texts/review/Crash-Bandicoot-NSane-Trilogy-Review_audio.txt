The soundtrack of the originals were never really a large talking point for the majority of the fan base. That is likely to change however, as the entire soundtrack has been rebuilt from the ground up. Most of the characters also received newly recorded dialogue accompanying their cutscenes.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From every bosses signature theme to the smashing of a wumpa crate, all of the audio present in the N.Sane trilogy is notably better than the rough tunes that once came before. A future &lt;i&gt;Crash Bandicoot&lt;/i&gt; game with an all original soundtrack is starting to sound very appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
