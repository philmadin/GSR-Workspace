The grubby, washed out appearance of the game is pretty spot on. The lack of colour, old rickety landscape and commonality of zombie-esque enemies all work together well. However after a short amount of time, the world begins to blend together like smeared, grey watercolour, and with such a variety of different paths to take, itâ€™s easy to become lost. That said, the 2D side scrolling is a good choice, not only to avoid copyright claims, but it also aids in the combat and progression.
