<br>The gameplay of <i>Color Splash</i> emulates that of <i>Paper Mario: Sticker Star</i>, rather than the RPG leanings of earlier titles.<br><br><br>A point of contention during the pre-release build-up, I myself was skeptical, as I wasn't a fan of the 3DS entry. However, I'm happy to report that the paint-based mechanics work very well.<br><br><br>Set on a 2.5D plane, <i>Color Splash</i> combines platforming with turn-based combat, as is tradition. What differs in this installment is Mario's power to colour in his surroundings. Collecting globules of primary hues from his environment, he can fill in empty spaces with whacks of his hammer, as well as bring certain objects back to life. <br><br><br>Battles also use this mechanic. In order to fight, Mario needs to amass battle cards (which are thankfully plentiful), with each card allowing him to perform offensive moves and use temporary allies. Using the GamePad, you can use your paint supply to fill in these cards, which give them more potency, and this brings a nice layer of strategy.<br><br><br>Unlike <i>Sticker Star</i>, I felt like this was handled much better. In the handheld title, I grew frustrated with wasting stickers, and having to constantly go back and get more. However, the paint system in this game allows for more freedom of experimentation, whilst still making players think critically about how the limited supply is used (particularly in the later stages of the story). Additionally, the amusing 'Thing' stickers (well, cards now) return, which are giant, random objects that are used in certain locations, as well as powerful battle summons.<br><br><br>On top of all of this, <i>Color Splash</i> introduces the scissors feature, allowing you to cut out certain pieces of the scenery (via the touch screen), and then pasting Mario onto a new plane of the level. I really dug this, which really added to the illusion that the entire world was one big craft project!<br>
