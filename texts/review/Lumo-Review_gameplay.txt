&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lumo &lt;/i&gt;is, for better or worse, an isometric platformer. I&#039;m inclined to say worse, because trying to figure out where you are and where you need to be in a faux-3D space is just as frustratingly difficult as it was over 20 years ago. The devs try to smooth things over with a slightly rotatable camera and 3 switchable control schemes, but I can promise you that you will still die many a time due to a jump that didn&#039;t go how you thought it would.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the restarts are quick and the lives are endless, which both allows for and encourages exploration. There are over 400 rooms to explore here, and almost all of them contain a unique puzzle to solve. Almost the entire gameplay experience appears to be&amp;nbsp;derived from games past: there are balls to roll, barrels to jump, crates to push, lasers to align, patterns to memorize, minecarts to ride and more. Some of these combine for some clever puzzles, but most will not test you, especially if you&#039;ve come across their inspirations in other games before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn&#039;t necessarily a bad thing though, as the nods are many and I constantly found myself smiling over a reference to or mechanic from a game that I had all but forgotten about. It&#039;s just a shame that this joy is quickly marred by the exploration itself - successfully navigating the dungeon is a tedious affair thanks to a sub-par map and lack of quick travel. Wow, I sound spoilt...&lt;/p&gt;
