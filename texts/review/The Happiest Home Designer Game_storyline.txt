Happy Home Designer doesn’t have much of a storyline. You start off as a new employee at Nook’s Homes. Tom Nook and the rest of the agency greet you and it’s not too long before you dive straight into the main purpose, designing homes. <br />
<br />
After that, you work your way up to genius and soon you’ll be creating shops and facilities as well. You aren’t limited to how much you can play each day either so it’s up to you how fast you progress through the story. <br />
<br />
After you finish all the facilities and shops around the town centre you have ‘finished’ the story. Despite this, there’s still a seemingly endless amount of villagers’ houses left to design.<br />
