&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dragon Quest VIII &lt;/i&gt;looked gorgeous in 2004, and it still holds up well today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though it suffers a little loss in detail due to the 3DS&#039; small screen, the game is still a joy to look at. Character models are expressive (thanks to Akira Toriyama&#039;s signature style), and the world is utterly breathtaking in its scope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there are a couple of niggles. There is no 3D effect present (with power issues cited as the reason), and I&#039;m getting quite tired of Square Enix relying on the same subset of NPC and town models in every &lt;i&gt;DQ &lt;/i&gt;game. Especially compared to the varied imagery of &lt;i&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/i&gt;, these repetitive assets seem more than a little lazy, and I do hope &lt;i&gt;Dragon Quest XI &lt;/i&gt;finally evolves from this.&lt;/p&gt;
