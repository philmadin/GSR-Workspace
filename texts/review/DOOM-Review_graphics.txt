<p>DOOM runs on id Software’s latest iteration of the id Tech engine, id Tech 6, and as a first release for both the engine and next-gen consoles the game looks fantastic. The environments ranging from high tech facility to demonic underworld are rendered with beautiful clarity and the demons look as despicable and disgusting as ever.</p><p>It’s clear that id Software took plenty away from their last release, RAGE, with many of the in games animations looking similar in both style and fluidity. Demons leap, crawl and slash with real weight and some, such as the imps, use the environment to their full advantage like hanging from pillars and jumping on top of crates above the player.</p>
