<br>The main crux of the experience (as any self-respecting videogame should have), I was utterly gripped by <i>Jotun's</i> gameplay, due to it's simple, no-nonsense purity.<br><br>An isometric hack n' slasher, the player controls Thora as she journeys across nine levels spread across five worlds, in order to obtain runes so that she may enter paradise.<br><br>Each level is wonderfully unique, both in terms of style and gameplay. Wielding an axe, Thora can initially only slash and dodge, but soon accrues special abilities that are hidden in each stage. These range from health recovery (Frigg's Healing), temporary invulnerability (Heimdall's Shield), and attack boosts (Thor's Hammer). These powers offer a welcome layer of strategy, and can sometimes be used to find secrets.<br><br>Despite this, combat is surprisingly sparse during regular stages, with many of them forgoing enemies altogether, in favour of puzzles (I use the term loosely, as they're basically 'go there' and 'do that'). I was pleasantly surprised by the variety, as Thunder Lotus Games seemed very focused on squeezing out as much variety as its limited budget would allow.<br><br>The other big gameplay feature is the bosses, which are basically the main events of each world. They are wonderfully designed, with good old fashioned attack patterns and weak-point openings that echoes classic like <i>Zelda</i>. They can be quite challenging, but are never insurmountable, and I felt myself slowly getting better and better after each defeat.<br><br>If I had any qualms, I would say that the fighting mechanics aren't really the smoothest or most refined. Movement is rigid, and attacking is very much subject to the whims of the animation - there is no dodge-canceling here. Additionally, the maps provided for each level are basically simple drawings of the layout. There are no markers, nor detailed information displayed. Despite initial annoyances with it, I began to find it endearing, as it gives <i>just </i>the right amount of info, without negating the need for exploration. Though some may not see it this way, I really liked how Thora's location was not marked, leaving me to approximate where she was in the level.<br>
