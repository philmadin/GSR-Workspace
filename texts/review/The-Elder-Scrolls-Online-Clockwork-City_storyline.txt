&lt;p&gt;Reports of mysterious shadow assassins draw you into Sotha Sil&#039;s Clockwork City to investigate a new Daedric threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Players commence their journey by helping a renown wizard in search of a Daedric artefact. As the story unfolds, players wind up chasing shadows, running to and fro quest givers and making some non-cumbersome moral decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main storyline felt quite short in the end, though given the price tag of 2000 crowns (or 4000 crowns for the Clockwork City Collector&#039;s Bundle) it resulted rather fair for a standard DLC.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
