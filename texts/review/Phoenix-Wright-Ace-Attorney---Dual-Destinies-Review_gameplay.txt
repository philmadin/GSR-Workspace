&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gameplay in &lt;i&gt;Dual Destinies&lt;/i&gt; is almost the same as in previous entries. You have investigation sections where you go around and gather evidence followed by court sections, where you use the evidence to interrogate witnesses and find the truth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A big element they removed is the free investigating. Instead of being able to examine wherever and whatever you please, you&#039;re only able to examine the scenes the game allows. With this and the &#039;helpful hints&#039; you get from your companion sometimes you might start to feel that the game is holding is your hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;re is one new feature they introduce which is the Mood Matrix. Via Athena and Widget, whenever a witness had emotions that conflict with their statement, you can find these contradictions and extract new information. It can be a bit difficult at times to find the exact statement and the exact emotion that contradicts but you&#039;re not penalised for a wrong guess so feel free to try as many times as needed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
