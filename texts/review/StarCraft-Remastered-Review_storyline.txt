The campaign is divided into three pieces, one for each race: Terran - humanity of the 26th century, Protoss - a group of tech-savvy religious warriors, and Zerg - an insectoid alien race that aims to consume the galaxy, with each campaign following off the last. The Terran stories follow the exploits of Jim Raynor and&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color=&quot;#222222&quot; face=&quot;sans-serif&quot;&gt;Arcturus Mengsk as they overthrow the dictatorial Confederacy, but soon find themselves trapped between the Zerg and the Protoss. Going into the other campaigns will involve spoilers so I won&#039;t talk about them, but rest assured the story-telling, characters and voice work is solid, some of the best around in fact.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#222222&quot; face=&quot;sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#222222&quot; face=&quot;sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#222222&quot; face=&quot;sans-serif&quot;&gt;As for the remastered content, what used to be nothing more than text is now replaced with nice artwork and narration. While I would have liked to see some remastered cutscenes, or even some new ones, the originals look decent in high resolutions, though they certainly show their age.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
