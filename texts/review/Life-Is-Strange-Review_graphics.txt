One of the main problems with this title is its lip-syncing. Watching the protagonist flap her lips wildly is quite noticeable at first but in extended play you’ll come to see it’s not that big of an issue. <br />

The art style itself is quite charming and generally up to the same standard as other point-and-click titles such as those done by Telltale Games.<br />
