&lt;i&gt;The Escapist 2&lt;/i&gt; carries over the eight bit, pixel art style from the first game, which goes well with the music and overall feel that the game is aiming for. The main improvement is a new customization system, which features over 20 different combinations for your character to look fabulous in while you plan your escape.&lt;br&gt;
