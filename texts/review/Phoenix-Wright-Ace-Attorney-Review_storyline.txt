The game starts off by introducing us to the main character; Phoenix Wright. He lives in a world where he only has three days to prevent his clients from getting a 'guilty' verdict. These cases gradually become difficult, from defending yourself early on to unraveling a cold case that goes back 15 years.  <br />

During the story, the player will be introduced to a cast of memorable characters, including Maya Fey, a spirit medium in-training. Her upbeat attitude and talent for contacting the deceased will become invaluable to keep you going when times get tough. These challenges include - but are not limited to - cracking a 15 year old case, going against a prosecutor who hasn’t lost in 40 years; and solving a dual murder at both the Prosecutor’s Office and Police Station.<br />
