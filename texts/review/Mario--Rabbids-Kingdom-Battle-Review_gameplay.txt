&lt;p&gt;In spite of its image, &lt;i&gt;Kingdom Battle&lt;/i&gt; is a damn solid isometric turn-based game. Controlling a team of three characters against an AI opponent, you have the flexibility to move, attack and utilise aura abilities in any order you see fit. You&#039;re able to jump off allies to extend your movement range and &#039;dash&#039; through enemies for extra damage. There&#039;s destroyable cover, AOE effect crates, and pipes that teleport you around the battlefield. All of these can be chained together for a turn phase that makes you feel like an absolute genius, whilst retaining that Mario vibe we&#039;re so familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sounds easy? Think again. There are eight characters to choose from, each with their own weapons, abilities and tech-trees. Each stage plays differently to the last in terms of layout and objective. The variety of enemies will constantly keep you on your toes, and they will overwhelm you if you don&#039;t prioritise threats correctly. Throw in some environmental factors and hit percentages to play with, and you&#039;ve got a game that will punish your mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, it never feels unfair. The small amount of luck involved with a successful phase cuts both ways, and while you may be cursing one round, you&#039;ll be smirking the next. To top it all off, there&#039;s a beautifully charming world to explore between stages, full of points of interest and puzzles to complete. While some are necessary to progress, others exist for the completionists who simply must have everything. Either way, I found myself having just as much fun out of battles as I did in them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
