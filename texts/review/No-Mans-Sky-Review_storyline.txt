While its poetic story-telling is compelling and curious, it ultimately amounts to very little with an unrewarding ending. Spoilers lie ahead, but I recommend continuing to read even if you haven&#039;t played through the game, in order to avoid disappointment and confusion later on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;&quot;&gt;The first part of the story involves following the Atlas path, which is laid out for you by a mysterious entity, and assists you in the larger goal of reaching the center of the universe. However, this quickly becomes tedious as the player must continually find resources to power up the hyperdrive, which allows the player to move between solar systems. After completing this quest and finding 10 Atlas Stones, all black holes (which allow players to more rapidly move towards the center) will be added to your map. Additionally, a &quot;new star is created&quot;. This has no impact on the player&#039;s game, rather it adds to the complex psychological sci-fi concepts behind the game&#039;s so-called story.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;&quot;&gt;If the player, being close enough, chooses to warp to the center of the universe, the game will zoom right out to show all the solar systems in the galaxy, and then zoom back in on a new galaxy on a new planet, where the player&#039;s upgrades are broken and they must essentially start again. The reasoning behind this is that the player is in a simulation, where their main purpose is to explore the galaxy, but this doesn&#039;t really justify such a disappointing and unrewarding &quot;ending&quot; to the game.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;&quot;&gt;Poetic language and high concept sci-fi is a nice touch to this already artistic game, but the pathetic excuse for an ending cannot be overlooked.&lt;/span&gt;
