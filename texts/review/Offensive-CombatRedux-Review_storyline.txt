One of the main issues with this game is the lack of a storyline. With the game being multiplayer focused, there isn&#039;t much to enjoy if players cant consistently find games.&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiplayer focused games don&#039;t need to have a story, but even a brief one gives players connect with the characters and make for an overall better experience.&lt;/p&gt;
