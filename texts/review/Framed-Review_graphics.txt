Make no mistake, &lt;i&gt;Framed &lt;/i&gt;is beautiful. Completely hand drawn, characters are mere silhouettes that contrast well against a simple yet detailed background. The animations are the real highlight - I never thought it would be possible to make someone move so smoothly. And don&#039;t even get me started on the flowing cloaks...
