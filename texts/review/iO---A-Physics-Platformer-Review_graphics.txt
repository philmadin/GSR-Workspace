The graphics are very clean and simplistic, which suits the overall feel of the game. There&#039;s not much going on in the background of the levels, so your attention is always on the puzzle itself. The platforms and the ball you play as look nice and it always runs smoothly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that being said, this game was reviewed on a mobile device, so it will likely look a lot better on other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
