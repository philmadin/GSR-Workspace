It was almost unnerving with how realistic the characters and landscape appeared to be. Although the range of emotion expressed by the character models was extensive, at some throughout the game, character eye and mouth movements were oddly animated, detracting from the events unfolding. Despite that, there is an amazing amount of detail in areas like the cabin and sanatorium. Exploring each area has a feeling of isolation, fuelling the need to solve the games mystery.
