&lt;p&gt;Scout and her dog, Aesop, must journey through a forgotten post-societal America ravaged by an apocalyptic flood. They raft their way down a river, scavenging for food, water, and other supplies to stay alive.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game doesn&#039;t delve too deep into backstory, instead leaving you to your own devices as you explore the harsh environment. This works in the game&#039;s favour, with a focus on survival rather than getting distracted by a complicated plot.&lt;/p&gt;
