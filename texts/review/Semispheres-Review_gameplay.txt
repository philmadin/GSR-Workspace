&lt;p&gt;Semispheres has a unique split screen single player gameplay. The player needs to control two orbs and guide them to the exit. Each half is identical except for the guard and power-up placements.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The objective of the game is to direct the orbs to the exit by sneaking past the guard. The power-ups give you tools to distract the guard while you can sneak past. You can connect the two sides of the screen using a portal in order to help the other orb reach the exit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each level is very cleverly designed and requires stealth as well as a good strategy to get through. It&#039;s very challenging at some points but nevertheless fun.&lt;/p&gt;
