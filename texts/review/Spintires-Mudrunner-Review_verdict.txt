In spite of it playing more like a tech demo than a fully realised game, there is still a lot to like about &lt;i&gt;Spintires: Mudrunner&lt;/i&gt;. It can take an eternity to get your dirty and battered convoy to where it needs to be, but successfully navigating the inhospitable terrain is definitely rewarding if you&#039;re up for the challenge. With such an awesome physics playground available to you though, I just wish that there was more to do than deliver logs.
