&lt;i&gt;Assassin&#039;s Creed Origins&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;is not without its glitches, pacing issues, and terrible characters. But as one of very few people who gave &lt;i&gt;Assassin&#039;s Creed Unity &lt;/i&gt;a chance and genuinely enjoyed it, I can confidently say that &lt;i&gt;Origins &lt;/i&gt;is the best AC game since &lt;i&gt;Black Flag &lt;/i&gt;or even &lt;i&gt;Brotherhood&lt;/i&gt;. It also might just be the best &lt;i&gt;Far Cry &lt;/i&gt;since &lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;, but at the end of the day, it just swaps out some of the worst parts of &lt;i&gt;Assassin&#039;s Creed&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;for more generic RPG elements. Add a beautiful world and some great combat systems to a cliched story and a frustrating open world, and there you have it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Review Copy Supplied by Ubisoft.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
