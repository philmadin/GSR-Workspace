Starting in the year 2056, <i>Xenoblade Chronicles X</i> begins with an alien invasion on Earth; with two warring intergalactic factions using our blue marble as a final battlefield. Realising their impending doom, humankind decides to flee to the stars, using massive vessels known as 'arks'. Unfortunately, most are destroyed by alien fire - with only one known to escape; the American 'White Whale'.<br><br>Cut forward two moths later, and the White Whale is besieged once more as it floats in space, before it crashes on to the nearby planet of Mira. It's here where the game begins.<br><br>You play as a custom created character; a survivor who is awakened in their stasis pod by a soldier named Elma. She tells you that the White Whale broke apart during its crash landing, with the remaining vestiges of humankind forming 'New LA' within the ship's leftover living sector. Here, civilisation is busy trying to rebuild, and its very way of life is protected by the military organisation BLADE ('Builders of the Legacy After the Destruction of Earth'). After a lengthy introduction, you then join BLADE, and are tasked with exploring Mira and helping humans thrive in their new habitat, all the while fighting off alien forces hell-bent on your destruction.<br><br>The premise is certainly interesting; though I can't say the story was as good as the game's Wii predecessor. I wasn't a big fan of the move to sci-fi from fantasy, with some of the plot's more absurd elements jarring with the supposed 'real world' setting. Also, the main 12 chapters need to have certain conditions met in order to be accessed, which will undoubtedly annoy some - though as a completionist, I personally didn't mind. <br>
