Peter Dinklage (Tyrion) is particularly radiant and highlights why fans of Destiny were so disappointed when it is clearly shown here that he is capable of excellent voice work. Emilia Clarke (Daenerys), Lena Headey (Cersei), Kit Harrington (Jon Snow), Iwan Rheon (Ramsay) and Natalie Dormer (Margaery) all contribute to this title and embody their characters to an impressive degree. <br />
