This is possibly the greatest episode ever released for &lt;i&gt;Life Is Strange&lt;/i&gt; and that in itself is an amazing feat. Chloe&#039;s story is definitely one worth telling. I had some reservations when I initially heard that &lt;i&gt;Life Is Strange&lt;/i&gt; was releasing a prequel. What more could be said? It was a complete package. Well I had no idea what Deck Nine had coming for me. This is episodic gaming done right, one where I am feverishly waiting for the next release. There are only three full length episode&#039;s for &lt;i&gt;Before The Storm&lt;/i&gt;, but sometimes quality truly does trump quantity.
