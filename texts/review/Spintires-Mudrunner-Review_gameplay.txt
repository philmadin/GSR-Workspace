&lt;p&gt;As the name implies, &lt;i&gt;Spintires: Mudrunner&lt;/i&gt; will see you spinning your tyres in mud, and what glorious mud it is. Thick, gelatinous, gloopy and accurately simulated down to almost molecular level, it needs to be understood and respected if you&#039;re going to get anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have a selection of off-road vehicles to choose from that can be outfitted however you like (log carrier, fuel tanker, spares vehicle etc). The goal is to pick up wood from logging stations and deliver it to mills scattered around the 6 maps. This isn&#039;t as easy as it sounds though; the mud realistically reacts to the weight and movement of your vehicle which in turn offers a unique risk vs. reward mechanic.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you take multiple smaller loads, you&#039;ll quickly turn the road into an undrivable mess as you churn it up with each pass. Or, you could load up your truck with as many logs as it can take and burn litres of fuel pushing axle-deep through the sludge. Getting bogged or running out of fuel are regular occurrences - and while you do have access to diff locks, winches and recovery vehicles, it is entirely possible to get so stuck you have to restart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is an exercise in patience, this logging business. It&#039;s also difficult, with even casual mode requiring careful use of gearing and navigation. And yet in spite of all of this, I found it quite remedial, trying to find the most efficient way of delivering my logs and minimising time saving my own arse. It&#039;s just a shame that that&#039;s all you really have to do here - with the exception of some challenges to mix things up, there&#039;s not a lot else to this game. Modding is thankfully supported, however, so hopefully the community can address that.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
