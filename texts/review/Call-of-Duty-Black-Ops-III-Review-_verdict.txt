Zombies and Multiplayer is where it's at for most fans of the franchise. New characters and progression system have been introduced to improve the experience for Zombies. Meanwhile in Multiplayer, Specialists have been added. Similar to the campaign, each character has a unique ability and weapon that suits a certain play-style. These two aspects of the game will provide more hours of entertainment long after the campaign is completed.<br />
