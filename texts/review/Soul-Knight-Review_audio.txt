The pumping soundtrack behind the arcadey sound effects is a mixture of high energy rock and chip tunes. The first level in particular is wickedly catchy, and once again keeps tugging on those nostalgia strings. It can get grating after a while thanks to a short loop time, but never to the point I wanted to turn it off.
