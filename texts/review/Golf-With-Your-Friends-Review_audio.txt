If missing that final putt wonâ€™t drive you insane, then the repetitive soundtrack will! One song will accompany you whilst you peruse the main screen, also joining you on your adventure throughout each map. Thankfully you can mute it and play your own music, which has to be intended, unless a revamped score is coming down the track.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
