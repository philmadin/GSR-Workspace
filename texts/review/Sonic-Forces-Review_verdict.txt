What can I say about &lt;i&gt;Sonic Forces&lt;/i&gt; that hasn&#039;t been said about every other 3D Sonic game of the past 15 years?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The story is bland and uninteresting, the gameplay jumps between perspectives too often for anyone to enjoy any level, and the voice acting is so abysmally dull that I would rather talk to an actual hedgehog.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All up this is just a boring game, that isn&#039;t particularly fun to play or listen to at all. Which is made worse since &lt;i&gt;Sonic Mania&lt;/i&gt; showed what the fans really wanted from a Sonic game.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;
