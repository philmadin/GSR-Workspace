Sony has made of point of producing an assortment of classic PlayStation remasters and the &lt;i&gt;WipEout: Omega Collection&lt;/i&gt; is one of the best yet. It may be a bit daunting for unfamiliar players but for anyone who&#039;s enjoyed &lt;i&gt;WipEout&lt;/i&gt; in the past, let me tell you that you will love it even more this time round.
