<p>DOOM happens to be a reboot of the iconic series, and with that being the case, everything has been reset in order to create an easily disgestable origin story for players both new and old.</p><p><br></p><p>The game takes place on Mars within a research facility owned by the enigmatic Union Aerospace Corporation (UAC). You play as a very angry individual, referred to as a Doom Marine, who wakes up within the facility to find it overrun with demons and the forces of Hell. Using a vast array of weapons, artefacts and good old fashioned fisticuffs, you take it upon yourself to find the source of the demonic invasion and stop it the only way you know how; with the power of love. And by love I mean the heel of your boot.</p><p>The story here is obviously pretty threadbare, but<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Â as advice to allow players to blast as many demons as possible it works and the over the top presentation makes it fun.</span></p>
