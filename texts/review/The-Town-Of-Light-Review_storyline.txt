Set in the Volterra Psychiatric Asylum in Italy, you explore the now closed asylum as &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;Renee&lt;/span&gt;, a former patient. Suffering from a mental illness, you must decipher the events surrounding her dark past. As you uncover more details, you must examine her memories and make decisions regarding &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;her&lt;/span&gt;. These decisions then determine how the story will develop. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The story is the strongest aspect of &lt;i&gt;The Town of Light&lt;/i&gt;. Knowing that the game is based on real events, adds an emotional intensity that is often hard to execute. It is difficult to connect to &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;Renee&lt;/span&gt; initially, but, as you dig further into her past, you will find yourself getting more curious and eager to solve the mystery. &lt;br&gt;
