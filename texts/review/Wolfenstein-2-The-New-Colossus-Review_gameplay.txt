The gameplay really gives the player a cathartic experience, making you truly feel like an unkillable death machine capable of taking down an entire army in a single strike.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus&lt;/i&gt; plays very much the same as 2016&#039;s &lt;i&gt;DOOM&lt;/i&gt;, in that it&#039;s very fast-paced, making the player feel like they&#039;re actually in the moment dodging bullets and in general trying not to die every three&amp;nbsp;steps. &lt;br&gt;
