&lt;i&gt;Agents of MAYHEM &lt;/i&gt;is a good attempt to make something different and fresh after spending so long on the &lt;i&gt;Saints Row&lt;/i&gt; series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But &lt;i&gt;Agents of MAYHEM &lt;/i&gt;is a game that is struggling to find its own identity in the marketplace. Is it &lt;i&gt;Saints Row&lt;/i&gt;? Is it &lt;i&gt;Overwatch&lt;/i&gt;? I cannot come up with a proper answer to this because it does both so well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nevertheless it&#039;s a fun game to play, and while the banter between characters is a great touch, the music leaves a lot to be desired. If you are a fan of &lt;i&gt;Saints Row &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Overwatch&lt;/i&gt;, then this is the game for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(This message will self destruct in 10 seconds).&lt;br&gt;
