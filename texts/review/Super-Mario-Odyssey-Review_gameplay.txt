&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake, this is Mario at his absolute best. Mario responds to input like a cat to a laser beam - and he must, because you&#039;ll be running, jumping, flipping, swimming and stomping through some of the best, platform-iest kingdoms we&#039;ve seen in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Mario brings his standard bag of tricks to the table, Cappy opens up a whole new way of interacting with the world. He can be thrown as a weapon, used as a shield and even levitated in place as a temporary jump pad. His most impressive skill, however, is his capture ability: throw him at an enemy and you&#039;ll take control of them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are over 50 characters to control in &lt;i&gt;Odyssey&lt;/i&gt;, and you&#039;ll need them all to progress. From Goombas and Cheep-Cheeps to a surprisingly realistic T-Rex or even a cheese fork, they are expertly implemented into their respective kingdoms and add a whole extra dimension to the already solid platforming experience. With so many ways of traversing the beautiful worlds, this is where the challenge and subsequent fun is found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&#039;ll be using the combined abilities of Mario, Cappy and Cappy&#039;s capturees to thwart bosses and find Power Moons. Power Moons are the currency for collecting and progressing, and there&#039;s over 900 of them to find across 17 kingdoms. The game can be finished with just 124 of them, but trust me on this, you&#039;ll want to find them all.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
