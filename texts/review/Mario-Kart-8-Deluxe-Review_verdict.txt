In all, &lt;i&gt;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&lt;/i&gt; is a superb package.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#039;s positively jam-packed with content, looks gorgeous, is super-tight - and with the extensive couch multiplayer modes and online community, will last you forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Go and get it, and face the wrath of my pink scooter-riding Link!&lt;br&gt;
