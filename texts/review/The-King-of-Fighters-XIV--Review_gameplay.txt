<br>As expected, this is where the meat and potatoes of <i>KoF XIV</i> lie. The series has long been venerated for its ocean-deep gameplay, and the latest installment doesn't disappoint.<br><br><br>At its base, things are as you'd expect. There are light and heavy punches and kicks, and you hold back to block. Going deeper into the mechanics, you'll learn that blocking actually depletes a stamina bar (which I'm always a big fan of), and a another triple-bar fills up, enabling you to unleash classic EX moves, such as 'Super Special' and 'Climax Super Special Moves', in addition to the third-tier 'Max Super Special' (which can only be used in Max Mode). Players of <i>Street Fighter</i> will be familiar with this set-up, which creates a risk-reward dynamic. If this sounds too complicated, there's also an easier 'Rush Combo' for more casual players (like, er, me).<br><br><br>On top of this, the angle and height of your jumps can also influence your fighting style, with different attacks performed depending on how you play the air game. Those with faster reflexes can also recover from knock-back by pressing a button before hitting the floor, in addition to performing counters. Especially crafty players can even take advantage of the EX system, by intentionally faking-out opponents through canceling super moves and laying the smackdown with even more devastating moves.<br><br><br>Make no mistake, this is an incredibly deep game. Feature-wise, it's basically what you'd expect from a fighting title. There's the standard story mode, as well as survival, time trial, three vs. three, and one on one. Of course, there the expected online modes, but these are limited to the aforementioned team and single modes, as well as party.<br><br><br>Either way, players will have a lot of time to experiment, with a massive 50 fighters, including <i>Fatal Fury</i> alumni - the legendary Terry Bogard!<br>
