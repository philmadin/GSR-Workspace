Choices within gameplay seem inconsequential atfirst, do you leave a wounded soldier to die, put a bullet in him ortrigger the scripted execution. The difference is minimal, it comesdown to do you want to waste a bullet or not, but as the gameprogresses further into the dark places that it goes something sosimple can be quite challenging.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 108%">As for storychoices I will not spoil them. All I shall say is that all of themhave some meaning, even if you donâ€™t realise it at first, and thegame is worth playing through more than once to experience thedifferent options.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 108%">It also happens to feature some of what are hands down the bestcinematic moments of gameplay. From fighting enemies amongstdisorienting strobes to defending convoys, helicopter fights andshootouts against seemingly insurmountable odds, each victory feelsearned rather than given, as if you have fought tooth and nail togain the upper hand.</p>
