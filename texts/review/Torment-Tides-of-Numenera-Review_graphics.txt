&lt;p&gt;The graphics are gorgeous - aside from some funky characters. The maps are utterly delightful and are guaranteed to make you want to explore every inch of it (you may even find couple of shins to spend at the &#039;ol meat market).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The framerate can be a bit average when exploring maps, however it&#039;s all-round unnoticeable. Loading screens have phenomenal artwork based on different locations and almost distract you from how many of them you encounter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
