&lt;i&gt;Antihero&#039;s&lt;/i&gt; Victorian art style really sets it apart from the other turn-based strategy games, and because it&#039;s in 2D it means anyone can play on any computer or tablet device. I like &lt;i&gt;Antihero&#039;s&lt;/i&gt; art style because of the detail of all the characters; from the nine playable thieves to the thugs, gangs and other characters. Time has been put into making them era accurate and every map tells a different story.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;
