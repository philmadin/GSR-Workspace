From the beginning, <i>Final Fantasy XV</i> deliberately throws you into the deep end, as Prince Noctis travels to wed Lady Lunafreya of Tenabrae. Both you and Noctis are oblivious to current events as he attempts to secure a treaty with the Niflheim Empire. Trouble soon starts and Noctis must do what he can to save his kingdom and bride to be. <br><br>The main storyline felt lacking as it failed to establish connections and backstory for the main characters. The attempts of character building fall flat, with the exception of Ardyn and Noctis, who are the most interesting characters in the game. The story improves about midway through as major events take place, but it ultimately feels too short and rushed. It is missing the <i>Final Fantasy</i> spark.<br>
