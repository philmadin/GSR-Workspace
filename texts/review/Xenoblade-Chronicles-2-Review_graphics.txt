Built upon the &lt;i&gt;Xenoblade Chronicles X&lt;/i&gt; engine, the performance of &lt;i&gt;Xenoblade Chronicles 2&lt;/i&gt; is amazing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Utilizing a quasi-anime style, the game is utterly gorgeous to look at, and I cannot fathom how the designers at Monolith have so much imagination.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each titan is an utter marvel in their immensity, and the environments are positively packed with detail. Characters and creatures are lovely to look at, and the advancements made to the lighting make their models pop. Again, like the previous &lt;i&gt;Xenoblade&lt;/i&gt; games, everything loads incredibly quickly. You can instantaneously transport to anywhere in the world, and the instances of detail taking a few seconds to load in is a perfectly welcome trade-off, in my opinion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, there is one big caveat. Playing the game in portable mode is remarkably ugly, with sub-HD resolution (even though the game runs at 720p on TV) that can go as low as 360p. Here&#039;s hoping they issue a patch sooner than later!&lt;br&gt;
