The graphics are very average. The game doesn&#039;t stand out and there is next to nothing that will catch your eye. The game has for a cartoonish and is a silly feel to it. This doesn&#039;t mean that the graphics are horrendous, they&#039;re just behind the times. It doesn&#039;t look like a game which was released in 2017
