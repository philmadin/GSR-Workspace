&lt;i&gt;Evil Genome&lt;/i&gt; really gives off a feeling of &lt;i&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;Castlevania&lt;/i&gt;. The characters all have a unique look to them which makes a game, which otherwise feels generic, stand out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game graphically comes across as polished. The environments (while most of the game takes place within underground caves) are brimming with detail and encourage the player to explore any and every possible avenue the game has to offer. &lt;br&gt;
