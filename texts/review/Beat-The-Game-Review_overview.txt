&lt;i&gt;Beat The Game&lt;/i&gt; is an adventure + music-making game that reeks of surrealism. The game&#039;s visual art is very original, clever and truly out of this world. It&#039;s not exactly challenging or fun to actually &#039;beat&#039; the game, but the visual experience alone is more than enough to keep you engaged. It&#039;s almost disappointing that it got over so soon. The music-making aspect of the game is also interesting and fun.
