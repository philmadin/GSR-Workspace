&lt;i&gt;Matterfall&lt;/i&gt; lacks innovation and refinement. While it may be a simple side-scrolling game, Avalon&#039;s abilities feel lackluster. In fights, you feel as though you can&#039;t rely on your abilities as there is no notification that they are available again after cooldown. This leads to mistakes and spamming, hoping that something will work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The augments and abilities collected seem unnecessary. Avalon&#039;s base abilities such as her Strike are enough to finish most levels.&lt;i&gt; Matterfall &lt;/i&gt;should have focused on an upgrade system, instead of trying to tack on gimmicky abilities. The controls were clunky and counter-intuitive, with Avalon limited in both shooting and movement resulting in cheap deaths. On top of this, long load times after a death really take away from the action. It becomes an exercise in frustration, especially when the difficulty curve dramatically increases as well. &lt;br&gt;
