Resources such as the distribution of energy from the central source of your expedition (which is your mothership) and air purifiers are crucial in the game. This aspect reminded me of an old game (&lt;i&gt;Earth 2150&lt;/i&gt;) that I found to be quite fresh in RTS games at that time. The air purifying adds an extra layer of caution the player must keep in mind while managing the resources.&amp;nbsp;During the gameplay, if you fail to defend even one energy distributor or air purifier, an entire block of buildings and turrets within the range of an energy distributor or air purifier would stop functioning - and that could lead to a chain reaction of really bad events. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creature attacks only get stronger each time. So rising from the ashes like a fiery phoenix after losing a sector of building could mean an almost-impossible task if there was no option to control building movements on Haya. Instead of units to manage within this RTS game, you get to move buildings (except your mothership), so that you could retreat from a losing battle with any movable buildings you could muster, and plant them on a safer location from where you could mount a counter-defensive strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If only building management was that easy. It is quite tricky to manage building operations without better short-cuts.&amp;nbsp;The game controls are a bit rusty, and could use a little improvement (for example, an auto repair option on repairing buildings) when it comes to giving orders.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
