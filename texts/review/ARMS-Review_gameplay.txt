As with any Nintendo game, gameplay is the main hook, and &lt;i&gt;ARMS&lt;/i&gt; delivers in spades.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I mentioned before, &lt;i&gt;ARMS&lt;/i&gt; is an attempt to revitalise the fighting genre - much like &lt;i&gt;Splatoon&lt;/i&gt; did for competitive third person shooters. Only time will tell if it&#039;ll be as successful as its inky forebear, but so far, what I&#039;ve played is very promising.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Presented in a non-traditional &#039;behind the back&#039; view, the big hook for &lt;i&gt;ARMS&lt;/i&gt; is... well, the arms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each combatant&#039;s appendage can be shot forth like springs, with each limb being individually controlled. As has been mainly presented by Nintendo, this is done by holding a Joy-Con in each hand, and thrusting forward - very akin to &lt;i&gt;Wii Sports Boxing&lt;/i&gt;. This seems very simple at first, but as you get better, you realise that &lt;i&gt;ARMS&lt;/i&gt; has an incredible amount of depth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You see, not only can each punch be thrown individually, but you can curve them as well - creating a game of duck and weave. On top of this, you can move, dash and jump freely around the arenas, grab your foes, block and unleash a special attack once you&#039;ve filled a special meter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In essence, this boils down to the &#039;rock-paper-scissors&#039; method of gameplay - punches beat grabs, grabs beat blocks, and blocks beat punches.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#039;s a simple yet utterly engaging mechanic, especially when combined with specialised stage hazards and gimmicks, as well as items that appear periodically, like bombs, health vials and rage-building potions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On top of this, each of the 10 fighters on offer have a unique attribute, which creates some individuality. For example, Ribbon Girl can double jump, Master Mummy heals when he blocks and Ninjara can teleport in mid-air. This ensures that every player will find their favourite - mine is the beach patrol robot duo, Byte &amp;amp; Barq!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In terms of modes, the game has the aforementioned Grand Prix, along with Training, Versus, Volleyball, Target Smashing, Hoops, 1 vs. 100, and the typical gamut of online modes. There&#039;s even a tag-team mode, which tethers two partners together as they engaging in four-player mayhem!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As you play, you earn currency which can be converted for time in a special minigame that has you hitting targets, clocks and presents. These presents unlock the &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; strategic key to &lt;i&gt;ARMS&#039;&lt;/i&gt; gameplay; differing weapons. Before each fight, you can equip three pairs of weaponised fists - and before each round, you can choose what fist goes on each arm. These vary greatly in behaviour, from traditional boxing gloves, to party poppers, hammers and laser beams. There are about 3,000 possible combinations, which creates another wonderful layer of strategic planning to fights.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a final note, on top of motion controls, you can play &lt;i&gt;ARMS&lt;/i&gt; traditionally with buttons if you prefer - and there is local split-screen multiplayer.&lt;br&gt;
