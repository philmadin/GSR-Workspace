As it was back when the original came out in 2006, the art style is gorgeous. Blending bright and colourful character design with a game-changing open-ended level design, this is a game that takes the player on a beautiful tour through Japan&#039;s Shinto culture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All of this is, of course, paired with the remastering main addition to the game, a sped-up frame rate across all platforms, and industry standard 1080p HD resolution. These additions make this the definitive edition for longtime fans of the game and new players looking to experience what all the fuss is about.&lt;br&gt;
