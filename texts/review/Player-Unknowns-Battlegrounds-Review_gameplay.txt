The only way I can really explain the gameplay is both terrifying and exhilarating. Never have I had my heart pounding from any game than&amp;nbsp;when I was in the top 5 of a match of &lt;i&gt;PUBG.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To say that &lt;i&gt;Player Unknown&#039;s Battlegrounds&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;PUBG&lt;/i&gt;) has some innovative gameplay would be the understatement of the year. The controls alone put most modern shooters to shame with the amount of work that has gone into giving the player full control of every weapon, attachment, healing item, and perspective they wish to implement in order to devise a tactical plan to get themselves a tasty chicken dinner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although the game gives you a plethora of tools to set a plan and defeat your opponents, you must keep in mind that every game is different. From the path of your ejection from the plane to where the foreboding circle has decided to place itself, nothing about &lt;i&gt;PUBG&lt;/i&gt; is ever simple or identical which really makes the player think on their toes and follow their instincts so that they don&#039;t just become another number on someone else&#039;s kill count.&lt;br&gt;
