<span style="font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">From a lengthy campaign, to both single and multiplayer battles, there is no shortage of things to do.</span><p></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 15pt; margin-bottom: 15pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The four races are all quite different. Space Marines are solid all-rounders, deploying the best standard infantry in the game and generally being decent at everything. Chaos are a twisted race, sharing many traits with the Space Marines while also being able to field daemons and other twisted aberrations. The Orks are melee focused, relying on leading overwhelming numbers of under-powered grunts. Finally the Eldar are a fragile race that prefer ranged attacks with fast infantry.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 15pt; margin-bottom: 15pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> Gameplay is divided into two sections, building and combat. Building is mostly standard fare; where it differs is the resource system. Having only two resources, requisition and power, everything is easier to manage with the exception of expansion. <br></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 15pt; margin-bottom: 15pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 15pt; margin-bottom: 15pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">In combat however, things are drastically different. Infantry are built in squads instead of the usual single soldier, with a number elements that need to be managed, namely reinforcing and morale. There are numerous buffs and de-buffs to this system, including special units that can be attached to squads and certain weapons and attacks that deplete morale. Vehicles on the other hand, have no morale and are a means with which an attacking force can punch through a defensive line.</span></p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> And that's not including the incredibly powerful relic units such as terminators or the mighty squiggoth. It's fun and violent, and that's what it needs to be.</span><br>
