&lt;i&gt;Let Them Come&lt;/i&gt; is an insanely fun game, that while it had no immersive storyline, it more than makes up for that by providing fast-paced, balls-to-the-wall combat which rewards the player for surviving waves. &lt;i&gt;Let Them Come&lt;/i&gt; offers up an oddly satisfying gallery of aliens to tangle with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This game is serious fun for those looking for a small yet challenging game to either pick up and play sporadically, or unload countless hours into disposing of all the alien scum.&lt;br&gt;
