The gameplay is similar to previous titles but has some new mechanics such as the zero gravity environments. The player is equipped with grapple hooks and boost packs to be able to move around in zero gravity.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the games&#039; most significant addition is that of aerial combat. Players can now fly &#039;Jackals&#039;, a fighter jet of the UNSA. Players have full control over movement and weaponry without any restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player can choose their missions via a hub in &#039;Retribution&#039;. The missions are classified into main story missions and side missions which unlock upgrades and story details. They can also customise loadouts at the start of each mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game also features a Zombie mode and Multiplayer mode which lack creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
