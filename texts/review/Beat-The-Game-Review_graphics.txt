&lt;font color=&quot;#333333&quot;&gt;It&#039;s obvious that I cannot stress enough about the abstractness of the visual art and the originality of it in a game. I would really like to see it extended even further in gameplay through adding new areas, elements, quests, sound sources, etc. But if the developers never intended it go beyond what it already is, then I cannot recommend this game for its &lt;/font&gt;replayability&lt;font color=&quot;#333333&quot;&gt;. In any case, the game has already made it&#039;s mark in the gaming world having won some awards for its visual art and sounds. &lt;i&gt;Beat The Game&lt;/i&gt; is worth playing just to experience the visual artistry it offers. Character design and animations are quite the treat when playing the game.&lt;/font&gt;
