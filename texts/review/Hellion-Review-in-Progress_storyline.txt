In the 23rd century, the Human race begins their first attempt to colonise a new solar system, Hellion. You are one of the million colonists making the century-long journey in cryogenic hibernation, except upon waking you find nothing. No colony, no people, no safe place, just a small outpost that is barely functioning. In front of you is a dossier containing emergency protocols, and that is all the help you have. It is up to you to get systems&amp;nbsp;back up and running, to find transport and to make sense of the graveyard in front of you.
