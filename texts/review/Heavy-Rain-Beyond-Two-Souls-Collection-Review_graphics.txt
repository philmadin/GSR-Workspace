Visually, <i>Beyond Two Souls</i> is the superior of the pairing with detailed captures of Page and Dafoe. Awkward mouth movements aren’t as common and character motion is less like that of a muppet. The environment in general is slicker and brighter than <i>Heavy Rain</i>.HR suffers from the growing pains of the origins of facial capturing that still haven’t been nailed down. <i>Heavy Rain’s</i> rainy deluge is useful however in hiding flaws that would be ugly blotches in a brighter environment. That said, the atmosphere is thick in <i>Heavy Rain</i> and succeeds in emphasising the depressive, dreary narrative.
