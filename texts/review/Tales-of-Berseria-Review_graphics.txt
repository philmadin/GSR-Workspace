The visuals of this title are its greatest downfall. It looks like something from last gen which is most likely because it essentially is, with TOB already releasing last year on the PlayStation 3.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;The fully animated cutscenes look terrific but the in-game engine is far from impressive.&lt;/span&gt;
