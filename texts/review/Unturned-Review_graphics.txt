The Unturned art style is not a pretty one. But that is not to&amp;nbsp;say that the game is ugly. While character models leave something to be desired and the pseudo-Minecraft visuals are hardly appealing, the game can often look very pretty, though it does require max settings and specific moments to do so. Be it a foggy morning, the sun barely penetrating the clouds; or a rainy night, lit only by the waning moon and the flashlights of players.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It runs great as well with a plethora of settings allowing each player to gain the maximum performance from almost any modern machine.&lt;/p&gt;
