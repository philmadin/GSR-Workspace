<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 108%"><i style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 108%">Spec Ops: TheLine</i> has little in the way of notable sound effects, at least outsideof the characters. It features all the tradition trappings of theshooter, guns go bang, heads go splat, angry men shout and sandstormsblock out almost all sound. It’s serviceable. </p><p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 108%">As for the music,its presentation is very unique. Played over the radio by theeponymous Radio Man, it consists of various tracks, each chosen forspecific moments, from Bad Boys to Nowhere to Run, they are bothexciting and perfectly placed. While the game doesn’t heavilyfeature an original track, those that are played can be both hauntingand epic, dependant on the situation.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 108%">The voice actingdeserves special mention due to how it changes across the course ofthe game. Captain Walker, voiced of course by Nolan North, it thebest example. A seemingly standard thing to hear in a video game, thevoice of Mr North, is slowly twisted until one will never be able tohear it and feel that comfort associated with his voice. It is simplyanother part of the game that seeks to settle the player beforeturning the tables in many ways</p>
