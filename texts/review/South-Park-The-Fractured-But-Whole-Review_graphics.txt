The graphics of this game are considerably crisper than in &lt;i&gt;South Park:The Stick of Truth&lt;/i&gt;, but there are some glaring technical bugs that will negatively impact the experience. The game is prone to freezing, sometimes resulting in a hard crash.&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;are also instances where loading screens will take way too long and character movements can glitch during combat.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;After a few patches, these issues should become non-existent. The animation itself is a world above the original, with unique finisher animations dedicated to each character.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
