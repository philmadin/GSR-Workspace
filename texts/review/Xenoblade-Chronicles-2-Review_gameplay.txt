At its core, &lt;i&gt;Xenoblade Chronicles 2&lt;/i&gt; plays the same as its forbear (and its Wii U &lt;a href=&quot;http://gamesharkreviews.com/review.php?t=Xenoblade_Chronicles_X_Review&amp;amp;g=Xenoblade_Chronicles_X&quot;&gt;spin-off&lt;/a&gt;). A JRPG with huge, open vistas - there are the requisite tropes that come with the genre; questing, battling, errands, relationship-building, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Combat is like an MMO, with real-time movement combined with turn-based attacking. Unique to this game is the emphasis on Drivers and Blades. During your journeys, every one of your heroes will be able to equip three blades in the field, and you can switch between them on the fly during fights. Each Blade dictates the type of weapon you use, as well as elements and skills. This creates an absurdly deep system, especially when combined with enemy placements, stats and weather effects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can create Blades by bonding with &#039;core crystals&#039;, and most resulting Blades (bar unique crystals) is totally random. This creates a deep, Pokemon-style of collecting, especially considering that Blades can also open new pathways and find treasures in the world depending on their abilities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eventually, you&#039;ll be able to send your Blades on mercenary missions, so by the end you&#039;ll have created quite an army!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The world of Alrest itself is huge, and each continent&#039;s economy can be built up by buying, selling, completing quests, finding new areas and completing merc missions. Exploration is super fun, and avoids many of the frustrating JRPG tropes. Dying only causes you to warp back to the nearest discovered landmark, with all of your items and experience in tact. However, I do dislike the fact that their is &lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt; autosaving whatsoever (aside from when you bond with a crystal), so be sure to remember to save &lt;i&gt;frequently&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#039;ve only touched upon the game&#039;s features, because this is an utterly &lt;i&gt;massive&lt;/i&gt; game. Doing everything can easily take over 200 hours, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; Nintendo will release new DLC content!&lt;br&gt;
