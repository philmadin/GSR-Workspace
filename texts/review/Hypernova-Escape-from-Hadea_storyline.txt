The star Naidira has become unstable, and there is a looming hypernova explosion on the horizon. Your home planet of Hadea needs to vacate all its inhabitants to another safe star system. To do that, you have to mine special resources found only on Haya - the naturally inhospitable moon of Hadea. It all comes down to defending your buildings of your colony on Haya from harm, such as electric storms, aggressive native creatures etc. Also, you mine precious elements to build an interstellar teleportation device for your species to escape its soon-to-be-consumed-by-a-hypernova&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;br&gt;
