Don&#039;t expect any fancy soundtracks, but do expect great sound effects. From the hum of the space station to the small hisses as you fire manoeuvring thrusters, the audio has been designed to complement the experience and it does that well. Just wait until you&#039;re in space with no atmosphere and consequently no sound... all you can hear is your heart beating faster and faster as you run out of oxygen.
