<br>The story of <i>Yo-Kai Watch 2</i> is surprisingly epic, with the campaign length reaching dozens of hours.<br><br><br>The plot begins with a pair of sinister Yo-Kai named Kin and Gin, who sneak into Nate's home in the dead of night, before stealing his Yo-Kai Watch and erasing his memories of the previous adventure.<br><br><br>Awakening the next morning, things start of simple enough, before Nate realises things aren't what they seem, as he slowly rediscovers the existence of the Yo-Kai.<br><br><br>I got the impression that Level-5 used the 'amnesia' plotline as a sly way to introduce new players to their universe, but either way, I was thankful for it, considering I never played the predecessor.<br><br><br>Nevertheless, the story soon becomes more intricate, as Nate eventually travels 60 years back in to the past (thanks to a blue Yo-Kai cat named Hovernyan) and meets his late grandfather as an adolescent.<br><br><br>If I had any criticism, I'd say that the story starts of incredibly slow, with the game forcing me to undertake menial tasks that reeked of padding. However, fans of Level-5's previous work know just how wonderful their narratives can really be, and you can expect some real tear-jerking moments here!<br>
