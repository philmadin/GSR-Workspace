&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;In Sniper Elite 4 you control U.S. agent, Karl Fairburne, who is dropped into a war-torn Italy in 1943 to assist the Italian resistance against the Fascists of World War II.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;World War II has been a setting for fantastic stories in movies, television and games, but that is not the case for Sniper Elite 4.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;There is a laid-out end goal that Karl pursues, but his motivation is not a personal one, which leaves him a very one-dimensional character. The secondary characters also leave much to be desired.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The most interesting story aspect of the game are the numerous letters Karl finds out on his missions. They offer a brief look into the lives of the German soldiers you brutalise throughout the game, and gives you an insight into the harsh reality of war.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
