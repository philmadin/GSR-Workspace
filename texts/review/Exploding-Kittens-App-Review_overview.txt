I remember eagerly opening my new card game, Exploding Kittens, after backing the original Kickstarter project. I also remember eagerly buying the app after waiting months for it to come from iOS to Android. And I remember my excitement dissipating after starting a game of the latter.&nbsp;<p style="background-image: url(data:image/png;base64,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); background-position: 672px 0px; background-repeat: no-repeat;">Exploding Kittens, which features hilarious cartoons by Internet cartoonist The Oatmeal, was the most backed Kickstarter project of all time. This is a party game of chance where some of the cards in the deck can blow you up, and others will lower your chances of drawing those cards. It was created by two guys with years of video game experience. So why did I find the app disappointing?&nbsp;</p>
