&quot;In a time of gun and sword, the magical stone that maintains the balance of the world is stolen by high-tech aliens. The world is hanging on a thin thread. It all depends on you retrieving the magical stone...&quot; That&#039;s about all the story we are given, and that&#039;s about all the story there is. Don&#039;t worry though, we&#039;re not here to experience a deep story, we&#039;re here for the gameplay.
