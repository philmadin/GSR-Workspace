Apart from a somewhat unfair matchup system, I&#039;d still say this game is worth every penny. The reason I used the word &#039;unfair&#039; is maybe due to how hard I found PvP matches with other users. But it&#039;s only fair to appreciate that getting used to the controls is half the battle.&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Battlerite &lt;/i&gt;is a game based on mastering precision, so I hope that once I&#039;ve practiced enough I&#039;ll get much better and start winning! The challenge in mastering the game itself.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#039;d recommend this game to anyone who loves PvP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
