The gameplay is a lot more focused than in previous seasons. There aren&#039;t huge empty areas where you seemingly wander around aimlessly, looking at trash cans and what not. Each new environment serves a purpose and every small optional interaction adds layers to the people accompanying us.&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game also features sections where you can play as Clementine in flashbacks, these are incorporated very tastefully. Not overshadowing Javy&#039;s story at all but rather filling in blanks that have occurred in the years between the past release.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
