Human Revolution was never a bad looking game and The Directors Cut did little to change that. Though there was some debate at release at the amount of visual changes the game did, at times appear to have cleaner textures and an overall nicer look, particularly in the already poorly rendered cut scenes. In its original release the in-game visuals where leaps and bounds ahead of the pre-rendered cut scenes which looked like something from amuch older game. The Directors Cut certainly improved them but not enough to make them acceptable. Outside of the cut scenes the game is a looker, blinking neon lights and shiny surfaces help to sell the cyberpunk world and the plethora of augment effects never give the player a visual overload. Though it hasn’t aged as well as some it certainly hasn’t fallen far behind, delivering a visually pleasing experience, despite the stupid yellow filter that covers everything.
