&lt;i&gt;Speedrunners &lt;/i&gt;storyline consist of nine races spread among three stages. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The story follows Speedrunner as he encounters a new antagonist, what follows is a few lines of cheesy sixties camp dialogue and a break neck, fast-paced race through a track set in a certain theme.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Speedrunners&#039; &lt;/i&gt;story may be viewed by some as thin by some players, but I believe&amp;nbsp;it is to the point and as fast as the races it consists of. The story never feels like it&#039;s dragging on -&amp;nbsp;instead, it&#039;s fresh, fun and filled with enough puns to fill a beginners open mic night set.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
