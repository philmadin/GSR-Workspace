Tethered is compatible with both VR and PC, and sometimes this can be evident in the gameplay. As such, the controls when they&#039;re moved sometimes feel too light, and you can definitely tell the game has been optimised for VR use.&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be prepared to slog through the first opening islands, as it does take some time get the hang of how the game works, the controls and how to build new objects on your island. A big point that I missed at first was combining the weather elements, which can be combined and tethered to your peeps or buildings to create a desired effect.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is always something to do on the island, and the constant faced paced day and night cycle always provides that there are plenty of battles too face, or restoring your island after a particularly hard night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping your peeps happy is of utmost importance in game, and if theyre not fed and happy, they will &#039;fall into the void&#039; leaping from places on the map to their deaths. This, while morbid, ensures that you&#039;re always on the lookout for every peep and their happiness, which is easy to monitor via the emotion symbol above a peeps head. If your peep falls into despair, they will refuse to do work or fight until they&#039;re happy again, so ensuring all your peeps are happy is definitely a large game point!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a negative, I did find the UI and the tethering system sometimes too crowded, as well as hard to navigate.&lt;/p&gt;
