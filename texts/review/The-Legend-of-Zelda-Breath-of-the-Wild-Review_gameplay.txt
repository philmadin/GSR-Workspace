I honestly don&#039;t know where to start.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The gameplay of &lt;i&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/i&gt; is some of the greatest I&#039;ve ever experienced in a videogame. The story I mentioned? Well, you have the &lt;i&gt;complete&lt;/i&gt; freedom to experience it in any way you want. You are given objectives, and you can follow them. Or, you can go completely off the beaten track, and explore the massive world of Hyrule to your heart&#039;s content.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can head straight to the final battle as soon as you start (good luck with that, though). Or you can focus on recovering Link&#039;s memories. Or try to beat the game&#039;s four massive dungeons. Or find the 100-plus Shrine mini-challenges. Or you can just explore. Meet people. Visit towns. Solve problems. Be a hero.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The influences of Bethesda&#039;s &lt;i&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Fallout&lt;/i&gt; are apparent, but Nintendo has taken that free-roaming template and injected their own design genius into it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is a strong survival aspect to this adventure. Link can hunt and forage for food, in order to make recipes and elixirs that offer special buffs. He can accrue countless weapons that will break after prolonged usage, like swords, spears, bows, shields, clubs and even mops and pitchforks. He can find minerals used for crafting, and money to spend (though unlike previous games, rupees are actually quite hard to come by).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Temperature and weather also affect our elfin hero; he needs to wear the appropriate clothing for the right region, and the heavens can wreak havoc on the land, with thunderstorms felling trees and lighting zooming toward anything metal. Blizzards reduce visibility to zero, and winds can spread wildfires.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Returning from &lt;i&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/i&gt;, Link has a stamina meter which affects his sprinting and the all-new free climbing mechanic. This latter feature is brilliant, and basically revolutionises open-world exploration, allowing players to climb anything and everything - allowing them to carve their own path through the land. Also returning from &lt;i&gt;SS&lt;/i&gt; is Link&#039;s sailcloth, which allows him to glide massive distances. These two abilities are particularly important, as verticality is emphasised, and (unlike other open games) you have very few markers telling you where things are. It&#039;s up to &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; to find things, and mark them on your map.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amiibo functionality is included, too. Regular &lt;i&gt;Zelda&lt;/i&gt; figures can be used once a day to spawn materials and treasure - whilst the Wolf Link figure will actually spawn the canine as your travelling companion. He can sniff out items, hunt wildlife and fight enemies; but if he dies, you&#039;ll have to wait until the next day (in real life) to use him again. I also must note that he disappears when warping or visiting towns and shrines - but you can scan it again to bring him back when you depart these places.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#039;s so much more, but I just don&#039;t have space (or want to spoil too much). Suffice to say, this is one of the biggest games ever made - and definitely the biggest &lt;i&gt;Zelda&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
