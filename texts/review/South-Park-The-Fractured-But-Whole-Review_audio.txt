Trey Parker, Matt Stone and the rest of the cast are in career-best form. Bringing the best out of absurd yet lovable characters such as &#039;The Coon&#039;, &#039;Captain Diabetes&#039;, &#039;Fastpass&#039; and &#039;Professor Chaos&#039;. Lazer blasts, martial arts attacks, even explosive farts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;It all sounds fantastic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;I do admit, describing the sound of farts as &#039;fantastic&#039; in a video game, is undeniably weird. But if anyone was going to get combative flatulence right, it would be the crew behind a South Park game.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;The soundtrack is also appropriate, applying heroic themes to many of the games set pieces.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
