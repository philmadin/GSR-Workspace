A New Frontier acts as the third season of Telltales remarkably famous &lt;i&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/i&gt; series and with that comes the weight of some pretty lofty expectations. This is their most famous video game adaption and the one that broke Telltale through to the mainstream.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANF tries to take &lt;i&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/i&gt; games as we know them, in a new direction and for the most part... it succeeds. Bugs and an unreliable technical performance hold back an otherwise fine addition to a beloved franchise.&lt;/p&gt;
