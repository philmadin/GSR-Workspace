The music of &lt;i&gt;Evil Genome&lt;/i&gt; really comes across as just plain, and doesn&#039;t inspire the player to explore any of the good things this game has to offer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The voice acting (at least for the English version of the game) is delivered with so little tone or emotion, that you could get better dialogue out of somebody in the middle of a deadlift (at least it would have more emotion).&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All around the audio in &lt;i&gt;Evil Genome&lt;/i&gt; is just lacking, and could&#039;ve benefited from more work put into it.&lt;br&gt;
