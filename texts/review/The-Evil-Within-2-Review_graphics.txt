Graphically &lt;i&gt;The Evil Within 2&lt;/i&gt; is a major improvement on the original game (probably because Tango Gameworks built a new engine in order to make&lt;i&gt; The Evil Within 2&lt;/i&gt;). The monsters feel scarier, the environments feel worth exploring, and the lighting engine makes the game look as though you are watching a movie.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Evil Within 2&lt;/i&gt; is a game that has been made with the current state of Survival Horror in mind. Creating visuals that would gradually build fear at a steady pace, instead of just doing jump scares every five&amp;nbsp;steps is a welcome change for fans of true horror.&lt;br&gt;
