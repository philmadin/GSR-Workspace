Instead of going for a fantasy environment Unravel focuses on the real and draws inspiration from Umeå, Sweden. Visually gorgeous, the game would do a fair job of convincing you to move to the top end of the planet. <br />

Yarny is adorable and fits right in with the setting. He isn’t particularly expressive as much time is spent with the camera away from him, he also doesn’t utter a word. However he will show fear, compassion, shock and appear deep in thought which allow him to truly become a character in the story naturally.
