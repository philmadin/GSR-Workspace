&lt;i&gt;Yooka-Laylee&lt;/i&gt; is a third person platformer consisting of 6 worlds which you are free to explore and where you can interact with other characters. Pagies need to be collected, and this can be done by interacting with other characters and solving puzzles, or by exploring the world and finding where the Pagies have been hidden.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gameplay in each world can be extended by using Pagies&amp;nbsp;at each world&#039;s book. Doing so will expand the size of the book, therefore making the world bigger, unlocking new areas, puzzles and characters to interact with. Within every new world there are new characters, each with their own problems or challenges in need of solving. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gameplay at times can feel very frustrating but that is mostly because of the camera controls, an uncommon problem in today&#039;s games..&lt;br&gt;
