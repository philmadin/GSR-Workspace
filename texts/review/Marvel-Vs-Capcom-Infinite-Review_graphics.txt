Simply put, &lt;i&gt;Marvel Vs. Capcom; Infinit&lt;/i&gt;e looks terrific. The art style is very similar to previous games in the series that returning fans will love, but still has that cutting-edge vibe that all AAA games strive for. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each character looks like they have been plucked from their respective series (Chris Redfield still looks like he could crush a boulder simply by flexing his biceps). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Capcom has really put in a great effort to make sure that the&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Marvel Vs. Capcom: Infinite&lt;/i&gt; characters come across exactly as fans remember, from Dante&#039;s oversized sword to Ghost Rider&#039;s chain whip (which is an easy way to get damage on a friend&#039;s character from across the screen). Every character, item, and super is perfect yet still totally unique to every one of the games modest sized roster.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The environments are dynamic and bursting with life, the super moves are unique for each character and look amazingly perfect. Each cutscene is beautifully rendered, really taking&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Marvel Vs. Capcom: Infinite&lt;/i&gt; to the next level.&lt;br&gt;
