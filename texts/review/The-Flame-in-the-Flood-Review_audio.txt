&lt;p&gt;The music provides a nice accompaniment to the game and overall tone. It matches the theme that the rest of the game has going for it, with slight undertones of a Western. When you&#039;re sailing down the river the music is peaceful and quiet, becoming more upbeat when you enter a new area.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are sections that don&#039;t have much or any background music but again, it just adds to the feel of the game, and the sense of isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
