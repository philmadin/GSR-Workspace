Aven Colony&#039;s gameplay is pretty straight forward. You (the Governor), start with a huge open landscape full of all the resources you will need to build a new home on Aven Prime, such as mining materials, water, geothermic power, and the all important Nanite.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All of these are important to creating a sustainable colony for humanity to live in, nanites are especially important to building as everything you build needs a certain amount of nanites. Luckily, nanites can be extracted from the materials you mine from Aven Prime, making getting nanites easier as you progress.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As city builders go, Aven Colony is one of the better ones in the genre. The freedom it gives you to craft your perfect home for humanity is second to none, and the story mode will teach you all you need to know while still providing a deep story that shows the player the dangers of settling a new planet.&lt;br&gt;
