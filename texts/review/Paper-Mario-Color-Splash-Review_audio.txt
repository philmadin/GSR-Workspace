<br>I was pleasantly surprised by the soundtrack, which incorporates lively fiddles and violins in conjunction with the typically upbeat Mario music. It's a real aural pleasure, and it's rare to see a non-voice acted major release in this day and age. That's not necessarily a bad thing; as an old school gamer, I love reading dialogue, and using my imagination to fill in the gaps!<br>
