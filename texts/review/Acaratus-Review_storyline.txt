There is a story here somewhere, but it&#039;s told in such a haphazard manner that I cannot recall anything meaningful. It begins with a muddled cutscene that drops a few minutes of exposition without any context and doesn&#039;t really improve from there.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Banner Saga&lt;/i&gt; nails storytelling within a tactics game, maybe &lt;i&gt;Acaratus &lt;/i&gt;should have taken a few pointers from it and other.&lt;/p&gt;
