Bloodborneâ€™s speedy combat takes some getting used to. To make life easier for no one, FromSoftware have crafted new bosses and enemies that are even faster, more unpredictable and require even more precise timing. It feels almost ridiculous at times the amount of performance pressure assigned to my thumbs. Yet, this is what makes Bloodborne so amazingly fun, and by realising this and expanding upon it, they show a keen ability to dismantle any safety we feel after mastering the vanilla game.<br />

Bizarre yet satisfyingly gruesome weapons and spells fill the gap of what was a previously limited arsenal. From the Whirligig Saw to the Madaras Whistle, the developers demonstrate a wicked sense of fun and creativity in their design. <br />

With the initial release being so well crafted, the combat found within the Old Hunters is able to meld with the old content almost seamlessly. This leaves much more room for creativity and advancement instead of being bogged down in maintenance.<br />
