Excuse me if I am gushing nothing but praise for &lt;i&gt;Little Nightmares&lt;/i&gt;, but this game is just that good. The narrative and soundtrack I believe is enough to make anyone fall in love with it, not to mention the beautiful art style throughout the game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you played &lt;i&gt;Little Nightmares&lt;/i&gt; and came out with more question than answers well don&#039;t worry, there is a comic series being released on the 3rd of May 2017 which will tie in with the game and shed so more light on the story and answer whatever questions the player may have.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think that &lt;i&gt;Little Nightmares&lt;/i&gt; hits a home run with how it does everything it set out to do. There are some flaws but overall it is a terrific journey from bottom to top.&lt;br&gt;
