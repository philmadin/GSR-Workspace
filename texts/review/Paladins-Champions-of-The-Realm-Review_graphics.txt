&lt;i&gt;Paladins: Champion of The Realm&lt;/i&gt; has a fantasy art style, with the maps being mostly villages, castles, town squares, and ruins. Seeing as this is only the open beta, these are probably only that base maps that will be expanded on with the full release. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each champion inthe gameis different with a lot of detail gone into making each stand out in their own way, and tell their own story. There are wizards, elves, dragons, robots, soldiers, huntresses. No two champions are the same, and with no storyline to the game it is good to see the developers have designed every champion to tell their story through their voice lines, abilities, and appearance. &lt;br&gt;
