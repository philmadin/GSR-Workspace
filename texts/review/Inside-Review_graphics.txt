<i>Inside</i> looks like something out of a Tim Burton nightmare and I mean that in the most complimentary way possible. Monochrome has never looked better. From the depths of the ocean to the run down ruins of a once great civilisation, the visual production is top notch. Every destroyed environment, every empty room and every broken tree branch are remarkably detailed, evoking a deep sense of loss. Like something terrible has happened in this world that we don't fully understand. Look at the still images of <i>Inside </i>on the side of this page and you will see just how gorgeous monochromatic colour palettes can be. The graphics of this game are hauntingly beautiful and are near perfect for an indie game.
