<br>Overall, <i>The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel II</i> was one of my biggest surprises of 2016. I walked in expecting a mediocre, low-budget barely-there anime - and walked out incredibly surprised by how <i>good</i> the whole thing was.<br><br>Despite its undoubtedly modest budget and presentation quirks, it provided some of the best experiences I had in a videogame this year. This is a franchise that definitely deserves more attention, and I highly advise RPG fans to take a dip in both <i>Trails of Cold Steel</i> games!<br><br>
