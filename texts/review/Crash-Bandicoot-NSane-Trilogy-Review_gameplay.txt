The level design is largely the same as it was in the originals. Massively fun romps filled with all manner of baddies, bosses and misfits. The gameplay is still a blast even decades on which is a testament to the quality of the source material. Things are just considerably more polished.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are still some issues with hit detection and the first game is undeniably harder than it used to be, but for the most part, the levels themselves remain faithful adaptions. Fighting those classic boss battles against Tiny Tiger and Dingodile really makes for legitimate fun. A perfect game to play with friends, family and loved ones where passing the controller can make for an even better experience.&lt;/p&gt;
