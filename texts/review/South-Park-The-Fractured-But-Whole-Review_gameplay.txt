&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;Some interesting gameplay additions include the new crafting system and superhero classes. As you level up you gain new character slots where you are able to place crafted items. Filling these slots&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#333333&quot;&gt;make you significantly more powerful. You also gain access to a variety of &lt;/font&gt;super-powered&lt;font color=&quot;#333333&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;classes with the ability to mix and match as you please. Some of these include cyborgs, elementalists and speedsters.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This increased specialisation makes each turn-based combat encounter, fun and unique. The game is definitely more challenging than its predecessor, so gradually becoming stronger feels well balanced when facing against tougher foes.&lt;/p&gt;
