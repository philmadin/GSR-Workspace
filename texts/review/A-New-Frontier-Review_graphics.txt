The one major letdown of the game is no shocker. You can probably already predict what I&#039;m going to say but it still has to be stated regardless. The game&#039;s engine is ridiculously inconsistent. I had about two hard crashes spread throughout the five episodes, which is an improvement compared to last years Batman. But this is still worrisome.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Telltale seemingly always have bug ridden episodes, especially towards the end of their respective seasons. They need to start releasing more day one patches for their episodes as losing a half hours worth of progress due to screen freezing is starting to become unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
