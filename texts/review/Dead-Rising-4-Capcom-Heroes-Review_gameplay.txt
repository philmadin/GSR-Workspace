Gameplay is one of the sections that really sets this game apart of the rest, and being able to play as any of the 15 available characters really makes for some fun during some of the more boring parts of the game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every costume requires a different approach, for example as X from Megaman you can use range and bombs to blow the zombies away or as Dante from Devil May Cry (original series, not that horrid remake) you will use a more up close, personal, and snarky slice-and-dice approach to clear the hordes out of your way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All around, the game has seen a huge improvement in the way that it plays. The vast differences in all of the costume really add a new dimension to the game and make it a whole lot more than just your typical zombie hack and slash. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
