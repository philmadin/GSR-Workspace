The world of Eos is beautiful. A mixture of modern and fantastical. It is a different twist on the classic <i>Final Fantasy</i> world. The main character designs are creative, while background characters seem to suffer in terms of detail and variety. At times, textures wouldn't load correctly and the difference in detail between Noctis and the environment was very apparent. The game looks great but isn't what was promised from trailers and interviews.<br>
