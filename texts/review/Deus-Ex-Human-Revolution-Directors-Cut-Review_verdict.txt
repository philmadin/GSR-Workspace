Deus Ex: Human Revolution Directors Cut is one of the better games to ever get a re-release. It plays well, looks nice and delivers a compelling and mostly human story that has pulled me back in time and time again. The mission variety and interesting characters are icing on top of an already delicious cake, a must play for those who have yet to experience it.
