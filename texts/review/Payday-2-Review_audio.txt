I have a love-hate affair with <i>Payday 2's</i>&nbsp;audio. On one hand it's great, the sound effects are well done and some of the music is downright cinematic at times (I recommend supersledge) while on the other the effects are often lost within each other and many of the tracks are aggravating.<p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Weapon effects such as gunshots and reloading sounds are top notch with differing audio for each weapon and even for each ammunition type. Bot chatter and the voice acting in general is entertaining, in a cheesy and rather lame way. Audio cues for enemy types are easily distinguishable and recognisable.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>But sometimes things don't go well and you'll wind up listening to an electronic version of Jingle Bells that makes you want to go deaf. Even worse is when the enemy audio cues are lost in the chaos, leaving you confused and annoyed as a man with night vision goggles beats you to death as you lie haplessly on the ground, with no idea where he came from.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The audio is very similar to the gameplay in that, while it works most of the time, sometimes it drops the ball and struggles to pick it back up.</p>
