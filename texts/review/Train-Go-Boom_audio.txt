Christopher Meloni manages to carry the game with his excellent performance. It is a shame that the rest of the cast wasn't as capable in their roles. Often the characters sounded unenthusiastic or were missing the emotion needed for the scene. This brings down the potential impact of the story as there is no connection between the player and characters. <br />

The soundtrack for Black Ops 3 has room for improvement. There is no atmosphere or noticeable build-up with the music in cutscenes or battles. Gunfire and explosions are overly loud and other sounds seem soft in comparison. The game accomplishes what it needs to without too much effort. <br />
