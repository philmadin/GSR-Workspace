Samurai Riot is a side-scroller, beat em up game. First off, the game recommends a controller but is only on steam, which can be a deal breaker for some people. Getting the hang of the controls may take a while. The fact that both players need to use the same keyboard if they don&#039;t have a controller is enough to drive players away from the game.&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are different classes that provide varying functions and playstyles; selecting a class that feels natural to the player is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game also involves making decisions which affect the game and the ending. This increases the game&#039;s replay value and helps it stay away from a linear path progression. The two players can choose to disagree with each other, which leads to a PvP battle, adding a fun and interesting dynamic to the gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With basic mechanics, repetitive enemies, lack of incentives and any real&amp;nbsp;depth to this game, it feels like a bland button mashing journey to the end of the campaign. However, the game can be enjoyed as a casual co-op timekiller.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
