<i>Mass Effect's</i> biggest failing, is also something the can at times cause just as much awe as frustration. The game struggles to handle the quantity of content it’s attempting to show. Walking through the Citadel, turning the camera in a firefight, even just observing the background can summon screen tearing, texture popping and heavy frame rate dips. But when you land on an untouched planet, lit bright red by the red dwarf of the system, or seeing the impending doom of a moon’s decaying orbit can almost (but not really) forgive these hitches.
