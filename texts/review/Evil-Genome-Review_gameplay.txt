The gameplay of&lt;i&gt; Evil Genome&lt;/i&gt; is uninspired and quite frankly basic, it fits the mould when it comes to the Metroidvania style but really doesn&#039;t stand out in any way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is not necessarily a bad thing, it actually does all of the Metroidvania gameplay features rather well. The combat is solid, and the platforming sections feel as though they are there nothing special at all - just your standard Metroidvania platforming section, which is a shame.&lt;br&gt;
