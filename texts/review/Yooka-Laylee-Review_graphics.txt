&lt;i&gt;Yooka-Laylee&lt;/i&gt; looks great, it has the same art style as games like &lt;i&gt;Banjo-Kazooie,&lt;/i&gt; but brought to life with modern graphics and animation. Everything from the character design to the text used in the dialogue boxes is designed to make you feel the joy most gamers felt back in the Nintendo 64 glory days.&lt;br&gt;
