This area of the game is pretty hit and miss. The music fits the mood the game shoots for, with a mix of upbeat 8-bit tracks and J-Rock really makes the player want to match the beat as they speed through each stage as fast as possible. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The biggest miss of this games audio is the voice acting, which is delivered with about as much emotion and enthusiasm as someone doped up on morphine. This as you can imagine really sucks all of the life out of the game, and made me fear completing any stage for then I would have to sit through another horrible cutscene.&lt;br&gt;
