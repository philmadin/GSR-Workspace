&lt;i&gt;Gran Turismo Sport&lt;/i&gt; has no story (that I could find). What it claims as a career mode is more like a comprehensive tutorial. &lt;i&gt;GT Sport&lt;/i&gt; will teach you how to race like a pro, and punish you for not being an e-sport pro.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;While this is fun in some ways, it isn&#039;t anything near what I would call a career mode.&lt;/span&gt;
