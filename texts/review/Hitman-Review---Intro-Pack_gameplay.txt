There’s been major improvements since the previous instalment, albeit a few changes may not sit too well with fans. For instance, there is no peeping through doors anymore, no shooting through doors and no slow-motion point shooting – to name a few.<br />
 <br />
That said, this instalment is extraordinary. Starting from the Paris mission, the game boasts extremely large maps, with more to do and explore. There are hundreds of challenges that players can participate in, such as discovering unique exits and disguises.<br />
<br />
The advent of missions has also had an extreme overhaul. The mission menu allows players to choose their starting location, weapons, costumes and view their challenges for the mission. Diana details every mission, explaining the location, targets, type of security (Paris) and restricted areas all in one digestible cutscene. <br />
<br />
When challenges are completed, players are rewarded with mastery levels. These levels unlock new starting areas and disguises, weapons and more. Don't be fooled though, this game is unforgiving as hell. It's only as good as you make it, so to be masterful, you really need to explore all depths of the game.<br />

As explained in the beta review, the gameplay hasn't changed dramatically compared to Hitman Absolution. However the sleek upgrades, such as finer movement, easier combat and more control over 47 make the game the best it's ever been.<br />
