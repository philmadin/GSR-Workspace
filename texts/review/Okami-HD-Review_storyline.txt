The story is the same that gamers fell in love with back in 2006, a journey of hope, humour, and beautiful art heavily entrenched in the fascinating Japanese Shinto culture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Okami HD&lt;/i&gt; follows Amaterasu (the goddess of the sun) as she emerges to battle an ancient evil made of darkness itself, a being called Orochi. Over the course of the game, the player is taken on an interesting and at times humorous escapade across beautiful landscapes, unravelling the mysteries of the land and how the darkness came to spread after being sealed for 100 years. &lt;br&gt;
