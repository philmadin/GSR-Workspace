The story has you take the reins of Imperial Inferno Squad commander Iden Versio, as the Empire is left reeling following the implosion of the Death Star 2 (real creative name, Galactic Empire) and the literal fall of the Sith Order.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To be honest, this game&#039;s story couldn&#039;t be anything other than mediocre. Since it was sold as being canonical, there were already so many complications that the writers encountered in trying to fit events in the game into the lore of the movies. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This of course made the game feel slower than Jabba The Hut at times, filled with mostly uninteresting characters, and questions which will probably never be answered.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;
