Daughter once again knock it out of the park. I look forward to every new song I hear in each episode because I know that they will be expertly implemented at just the right moment. Some scenes don&#039;t even need dialogue because the soundtrack itself can carry scenes towards their climax. I understand that putting indie rock music into a video game can be very difficult but &lt;i&gt;Before The Storm&lt;/i&gt; makes it seem seamless.
