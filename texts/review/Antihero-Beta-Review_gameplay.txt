&lt;i&gt;Antihero&#039;s&lt;/i&gt; turn-based combat comes across as standard at first glance, but after playing a few games against the adaptive AI, you really learn that the key to winning is going into the game with a strategy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The gameplay always had me thinking &quot;What can I do next?&quot;. This is exactly what you want from a turn-based strategy game, that feeling of &quot;Yeah, I&#039;ve got this&quot; can turn to &quot;What did they just do?&quot; in a matter of turns. If playing against the adaptive AI gets too easy for you, there is an online multiplayer mode, which pits you move for move wit for wit against player around the world.
