On a routine trip on a brand new ship, Commander Shepard is witness to events that foretell the coming of Ancient Machines known only as Reapers. Granted the status of Spectre and control of the Normandy, Shepard must make new alien allies, travel to distant, unexplored planets and save the galaxy before it’s too late.<p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Much like <i>Star Wars</i> and <i>Star Trek</i> before it, <i>Mass Effect</i> follows two themes from those series. First, it creates a grand, galaxy spanning quest, and two it doesn’t skim over the interpersonal relationships of the characters involved. <i>Mass Effect</i> is strongest when you’re having a chat with Wrex, learning of Tali’s life on the Flotilla or engaging with a universe crafted from scratch much like the aforementioned series.Choices make a difference.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Creating your Shepard involves picking a fully voiced gender, hero or tyrant, hardened veteran or crafty technician. Talking with characters can be done to intimidate, to charm or to ignore completely and move along. And critical plot decisions can have severe and series spanning consequences. Everything you do or say pulls you deeper into the experience.</p>
