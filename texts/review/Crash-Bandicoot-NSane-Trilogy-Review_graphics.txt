These N.Sane games are absolutely gorgeous to behold. There are triple A titles that don&#039;t look as impeccable as this bundle. This looks like a platformer made in 2017 and Vicarious Visions deserve to be applauded for their momentous effort.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fluid weather animations, high-resolution textures and even some pretty varied idle animations, make for a beguiling visual spectacle that has breathed new life into our goofy protagonist.&lt;/p&gt;
