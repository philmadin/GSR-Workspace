<p class="MsoNormal">Fire Emblem: Heroesâ€™ presentation is by far its greatest strength. As soon as you start up the game you are treated to a gorgeous cinematic, and as you navigate through the menu and battle systems, the classic Fire Emblem imagery and designs absolutely shine. Character designs are especially effective, and purposefully reference the original art of the games from which they originate. On the battlefield, the hand drawn characters are changed to animated chibi form when navigating and conducting an attack. Overall,the production value is quite impressive, especially considering the game is free -to-play.<o:p></o:p></p>
