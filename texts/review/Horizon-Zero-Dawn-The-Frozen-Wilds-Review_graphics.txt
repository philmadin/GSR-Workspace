Guerrilla Games has done a masterful job of somehow making the game even more beautiful than it already was. The snowy environments, strange new Machines, and overall character design looks magnificent. The game is simply bursting at the seams with an insane level of detail and the redesigned machines, paired with the Old Ones&#039; structures really give this DLC a feel that is totally separate from the base game.&lt;br&gt;
