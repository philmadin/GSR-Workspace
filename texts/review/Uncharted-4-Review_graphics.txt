The graphics are to die for. Each area is as stunning as the last with great cinematography that rivals any recent movie. Naughty Dog have made sure that Nathan's world feels like a living and breathing one with vibrant environments and gorgeous details. The game has included more visual and lighting cues that make it easier to direct Nathan through the action. The most amazing part of the game is the realism of each character. The facial movements and emotions captured make characters more believable due to the amount of details. The progress made since <i>Uncharted 3</i> is something Naughty Dog should be proud of.
