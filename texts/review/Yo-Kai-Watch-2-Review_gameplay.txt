<br>At first glance, it seems that <i>Yo-Kai Watch 2</i> is really nothing more than a Pokemon knockoff, but once you get your hands on it, there <i>are</i> fundamental differences.<br><br><br>First, the similarities. Like Game Freak's own franchise, you control Nate (or his female counterpart) on an overworld map, talking to people, finding secrets and completing quests.<br><br><br>To put simply, there is a <i>massive</i> amount to see and do. You can catch bugs and fish, find hidden Yo-Kai, solve 'Baffle Board' quizzes, search nooks and crannies, unlock special challenge rooms (with varied tasks), earn trophies, fuse items and Yo-Kai, and more that I'm undoubtedly forgetting.<br><br><br>The world itself too, is surprisingly huge. Comprising the towns of Springvale, Harrisville and San Fantasico, it will take you a long, long time to fully explore. Time even passes, with random weather and events, and to keep track of everything, Nate has a Yo-Kai tablet that holds special apps. These range from quest trackers, online modes, a music player, to Yo-Kai sighting reports and even rogue Yo-Kai to catch and apprehend.<br><br><br>So, what about the battle system? Well, this is where things get pretty unique. You see, when fighting, you hold six Yo-Kai on a rotating disc, and three of them can fight at once. During combat, you can dynamically spin them around in order to change your lineup. As this is happening, your spirits are attacking and using abilities automatically, which can seem too chaotic at first, but soon makes sense the more you play it.<br><br><br>There are different types of Yo-Kai (here known as 'tribes') and putting the same ones together will offer buffs. Sometimes, they will be 'inspirited' during combat, and you'll have to engage with the touchscreen (like rubbing or poking) in order to purify them. This applies to their special attacks, too.<br><br><br>After defeating enemy Yo-Kai, there's a chance that they will want to befriend you, and this is how you 'catch' them. You can also feed them their favourite foods during battle in order to win them over.<br><br><br>Of course, being a multimedia franchise for kids, there are a wealth of physical toys that unlock new content. Those with a file from the previous title can unlock three special Yo-Kai (Buchinyan, Noko and Komasan), and codes from the 'Yo-Motion' medals (that are used with the upcoming Yo-Kai Watch Model Zero) will also net you more stuff. Of course, there's also the fact that <i>Yo-Kai Watch 2</i> comes in two different versions, meaning there are monsters exclusives to each one!<br><br><br>On top of all of this, there's also an entirely separate adventure multiplayer mode, which lets you directly take control of aÂ  Yo-Kai in an action adventure beat 'em up!<br>
