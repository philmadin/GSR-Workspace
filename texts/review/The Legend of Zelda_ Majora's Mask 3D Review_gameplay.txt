This time-travelling mechanic is where the game’s magic happens, as Link experiences the same events repeatedly, and he must use this power of foresight to his advantage.

Forming the second pillar of Majora’s foundations, these magical assortments of face-wear imbue our elven lad with special abilities, including the metamorphoses into a Deku, Goron and Zora.<br />

Of course, being a remake has also enabled Nintendo to make improvements from the original. The Bomber’s Notebook has been revamped, and the schedules of NPCs are now easier to look up. The Gossip Stone hint system returns, and both a new fishing pod and a revamped boss have been added.<br />
