&lt;i&gt;The Escapist 2&lt;/i&gt; doesn&#039;t have a story in the traditional sense, instead all you are told is you are in prison and you don&#039;t want to be there anymore. This can make playing the game kind of boring if you are hoping for a gritty prison story, so I think the game would have been stronger with more exposition at the start.&lt;br&gt;
