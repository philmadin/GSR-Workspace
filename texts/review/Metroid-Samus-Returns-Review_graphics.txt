The graphics do their job, but aren&#039;t the nicest the 3DS has to offer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The aging hardware combined with the subdued, realistic art style doesn&#039;t paint a very pretty picture - and the low resolution is very evident.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still, the 3D effects are superb, and the framerate is nice and solid. Don&#039;t let the blown-up pictures here fool you - it doesn&#039;t look anywhere near as bad on the actual 3DS screen.&lt;br&gt;
