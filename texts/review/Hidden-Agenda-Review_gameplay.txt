The game is mostly played out like an interactive movie, with all of the players voting on where to go and who to question. Though this is the bulk of the game, Supermassive Games have also chosen to sprinkle in some elements from &lt;i&gt;Until Dawn&lt;/i&gt;, with the inclusion of QTEs (otherwise known as Quick Time Events) in order to keep everyone on their toes. &lt;br&gt;
