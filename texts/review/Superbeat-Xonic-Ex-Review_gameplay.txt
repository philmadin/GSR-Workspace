&lt;p&gt;If you&#039;ve played a rhythm game before, &lt;i&gt;Superbeat &lt;/i&gt;should come pretty easily for you - press the relevant buttons as the cues hit the bar. Ah if only it was that simple... &lt;i&gt;Superbeat &lt;/i&gt;has two of them (effectively one for each Joy-con) that require fingers of fury if you&#039;re to do well in this game. On each Joy-con, you will be using 3 of the 4 D-pad buttons, a shoulder button and the stick in both swipe and swipe/hold modes. That&#039;s a lot of real-estate to cover and cover quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you generally won&#039;t be doing more than one action on one hand at any one time, the speed and manner in which it&#039;s executed is overwhelming as your brain comes to grips with interpreting what&#039;s in front of you. Thankfully, cues on the &#039;highway&#039; correspond well to the ebb and flow of the various tracks, making even more sense as your fingers physically move to hit each one - this effect is amplified by how far you&#039;re sometimes moving to get to them, and once you begin to improve, this game becomes surprisingly satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an arcade game at its core, so don&#039;t expect a lot of depth. The standard &#039;Stage&#039; mode gives you a run of three songs across three difficulties, with &#039;World Tour&#039; giving you Clubs to work through, difficulty and modifiers increasing as you progress. There&#039;s a levelling system with some nice buffs and perks to be found, songs to unlock and that&#039;s about it - but it suits the pick-up-and-play style of this game beautifully. Play sessions can be as short or as long as you want, and on the whole are quite rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It needs to be noted that the asymmetrical design of the Switch makes the controls a bit awkward, and while you can play in touchscreen mode, I found activating some of the slides very hit and miss. Neither are deal-breakers, but they do add an extra layer of challenge to an already challenging game.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
