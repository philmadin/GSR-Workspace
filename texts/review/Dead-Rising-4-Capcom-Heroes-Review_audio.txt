The Dead Rising series has never really been known for its audio, especially due to a lack of sweeping and atmospheric boss music and stage setting background music. This game really makes a good effort to set a stage for the player and make you laugh, but at least half the time it falls flat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The injection of audio from other Capcom franchises brings new life to a game that for the most part drags along through the cliched &quot;zombie game&quot; tropes and non-engaging dialogue of the base game, and makes Dead Rising 4 a fun game to play. It brings music that makes all the challenges fresh and fun, and additional dialogue which pokes fun at all the seriousness that permeates through the other Capcom franchises.&lt;br&gt;
