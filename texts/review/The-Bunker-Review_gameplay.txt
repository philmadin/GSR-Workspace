<p class="MsoNormal">The game itself is shot like a film, with different camera angles setting up environments and following John as he wanders through corridors. The camera reveals everything through long cut-scenes (like a movie)  rather than allowing the player to take control. Gameplay itself solely consists of clicking nodes as they appear on screen and waiting for the video to play out. You may sit there for minutes on end watching the live action characters talk before the next option presents itself which may be off-putting to some players. <br></p><p class="MsoNormal"><br><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">As John you look around your environments for clues as to what happened to the other staff members and delve deeper into the mystery. This is where the game shows its potential as a storytelling device, leaving the uncanny valley behind and allowing the player to connect to the live action character as he struggles to piece together what truly happened. <br></p><p class="MsoNormal"><br><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">Players may look at this game as nothing more than a two hour cut-scene and it does feel that way, which just leaves you wanting more to do even if the story is compelling until the final frame. <o:p></o:p></p>
