&lt;p&gt;The world of &lt;i&gt;Origins&lt;/i&gt; is simply breathtaking - but that&#039;s about where it ends. You&#039;d think that one of the world&#039;s largest game development studios would have mastered facial animations by now, right? Everyone else from Rockstar to BioWare to Naughty Dog has - and even the studio&#039;s last entry in the series, Assassin&#039;s Creed Unity, did this so much better (when it wasn&#039;t glitching out).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other thing they should be able to nail is lighting. On the PS4 at least, the game has its moments. But the rest of the time, it&#039;s usually extremely desaturated and not very realistic. And night time just looks like someone&#039;s turned down the brightness a little on the daylight. Luckily, the extremely adaptable photo mode is always on hand to take the perfect screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The water and fire are great though.&lt;/p&gt;
