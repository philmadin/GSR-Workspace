The soundtrack to this game is phenomenal. Possibly the strongest aspect of the title besides its story. The indie folk band Daughter, act as the composers of the game, providing original music throughout.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each impactful scene is complimented by appropriate indie music that drives home the point. From beginning to end the music provides just as much contextual storytelling as the environment itself does. This soundtrack easily surpasses the original season. Bravo Deck Nine and bravo Daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
