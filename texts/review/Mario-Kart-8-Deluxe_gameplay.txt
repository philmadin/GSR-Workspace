&lt;i&gt;Mario Kart 8&lt;/i&gt; was a brilliant game in 2014, and it still is in 2017.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The tight playability of Nintendo&#039;s long-running racing series hasn&#039;t lost a step, with perfect controls, a massive wealth of customisation options, and tremendous course variety. New to the eighth installment are anti-gravity segments, which create thrilling roller coaster moments that have a direct impact on the race, as bumping into other players creates speed boosts, which has a subtle (yet large) influence on how races pan-out. Combine this with bikes and tricking (from &lt;i&gt;MK Wii&lt;/i&gt;), and the underwater and paragliding (from &lt;i&gt;MK 7&lt;/i&gt;), and its clear that &lt;i&gt;MK 8&lt;/i&gt; is the penultimate sequel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Content-wise, this is also the biggest &lt;i&gt;Mario Kart&lt;/i&gt; yet, with all the DLC packed-in from the original version. There are 41 characters, including new arrivals like Inkling Boy and Girl, King Boo, Bowser Jr., Dry Bones and Gold Mario.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&#039;s not all - new to this version is the revamped Battle Mode (with the Wii U&#039;s disappointing offering being erased), with eight new levels, and game types including the classic balloon and bomb battles, and the new &#039;cops and robbers&#039; inspired mode.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Additionally, racers can now carry two items (from &lt;i&gt;MK Double Dash&lt;/i&gt;), with two new weapons - the Boo and the Feather (&lt;i&gt;finally!&lt;/i&gt;). Another welcome thing is the new Smart Steering setting, which allows less-experienced gamers to avoid falling from edges whilst driving - and it&#039;s definitely handy for 200cc mode!&lt;br&gt;
