&lt;i&gt;The Town of Light&lt;/i&gt; is simple in terms of gameplay. The game is so story focused that other aspects of the game feel neglected. The speed that &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;Renee&lt;/span&gt; walks throughout is painfully slow and seems to drag down the pacing of the story. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The developers want you to explore, but, it is often easier to move the story forward then backtrack through various rooms when there is no real incentive to do so. Few collectables that you find are documents about the asylum and diary entries that reveal more about &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;Renee&lt;/span&gt;&#039;s time there. There are limited problem-solving situations and tips are provided if you become stuck.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most of these aspects are artistically driven and provide backstory. &lt;i&gt;The Town of Light&lt;/i&gt; doesn&#039;t pretend to be anything else, instead focusing on its sole purpose of storytelling. &lt;br&gt;
