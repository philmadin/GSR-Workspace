&lt;i style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;Beat The Game&lt;/i&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#333333&quot;&gt; encourages players to be observative of one&#039;s surroundings and to manipulate the elements to create something artistic out of it. I admire that in a game. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#333333&quot;&gt;Beyond that, the game is more than worth playing at least once for its visual elements.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
