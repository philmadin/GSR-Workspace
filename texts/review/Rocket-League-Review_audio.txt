The soundtrack to Rocket League is one of its most under looked yet strongest features. There is an assortment of catchy electronic music that are mostly composed by Psyonix sound designer Mike Ault as well as a few other electronic music acts. <br />

These songs create hype even before starting gameplay and I even found myself just waiting at the main menu so I could listen to the rest of a particular song. <br />

The matches themselves don't have any songs but instead produce clear sounding boosters, explosions and of course the sounds of motors and engines. The crowd roaring when a shot is taken and the subtle click when the tank is filled, all create an engaging atmosphere.
