The &lt;i&gt;Crash Bandicoot N.Sane trilogy&lt;/i&gt; has the potential to set a precedent in gaming where remasters can be just as good if not better than the games that came before. This generous bundle has paved the way for new Crash games in the future as well as other popular remasters, Spyro anyone?&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;future remasters should look to what Vicarious Visions managed to achieve and consider it a template.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;This is a stunningly well-crafted remake that has recaptured the magic of one of gamings most popular characters. Crash is back, and this time, he could be here to stay.&lt;/p&gt;
