<i>Final Fantasy XV</i> is lots of fun. Battles can keep you on your toes, forcing you to rely on strategy and friends to keep you alive. Each member has techniques unique to them that can change the course of the battle. These are separate from Link Strikes which are performed alongside Noctis and can produce increased damage to certain enemies. Both Noctis and the group can improve their abilities through the Ascension grid which is simple and allows you to prioritize what is important to upgrade first.<br><br>The variety of weapons allows for different styles of battling and each serves a purpose. Certain enemies are more vulnerable to a specific weapon and cannot simply be hacked away unless you have time to spare. Unlike previous games, magic has to be gathered and crafted to be used in battle. Summoning is similar but relies on meeting certain conditions before they can be used. I feel like one of the fun aspects of <i>Final Fantasy</i> has been restricted in order to prevent Noctis becoming overpowered by the end game.<br><br>One of the disappointing aspects is the camera and how it is unable to keep up with the action. It often gets stuck behind environments and fighting in closed spaces can be terrible due to the constant adjusting. The loading times for quests and fast traveling can also be slow, especially when a destination isn't far away and could have been walked in the time it takes to load. Despite this the game has plenty of content from hunts, side-quests, secrets, dungeon crawling and collectibles. There is always something to distract you from the main story. <br>
