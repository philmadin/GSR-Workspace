To the South, the blistering desert heat will beat down even the strongest of men.&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the North, the icy winds are sharper than even the finest of blades. And this is all without mention of the horrors that lurk deep below the surface. And then there&#039;s you, alone, unarmed, unclothed and totally unprepared. Will you make your mark on history or fall victim to this cruel world, as so many before you have already done?&lt;/p&gt;
