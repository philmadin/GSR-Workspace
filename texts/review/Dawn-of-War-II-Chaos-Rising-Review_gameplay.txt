Unfortunately, the gameplay is pretty much the same as it was before. The forces of Chaos are almost identical to the Space Marines in their unit types though the daemonic units are quite enjoyable. The major difference is in the skills, split between loyalty to one of two Gods. One allows the player to more easily heal units and summons demons, the other messes with enemy units, showing disarray and confusion amongst your foe. All in all, Chaos are probably the most interesting race available and it doesn&#039;t hurt that they&#039;re utterly insane.
