The gameplay, on the other hand, is simply outstanding. It took this reviewer a while to figure out how to control the hammerhead shark, but it was worth every second. (OK, I still haven't. Hence the bad score.) The maneuverability granted by this shark's unique shape is an unforgettable experience.
