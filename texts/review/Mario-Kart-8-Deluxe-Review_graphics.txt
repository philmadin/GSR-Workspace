&lt;i&gt;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&lt;/i&gt; looks absolutely stunning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Running at 1080p on TV, and 60 fps (30 fps for 3 - 4 players), it is an utter marvel to witness, especially combined with the gorgeous characters, environments and effects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though a Wii U port, it&#039;s still an impressive showing for the Switch - and I still can&#039;t believe such a small device can produce something so pretty!&lt;br&gt;
