Treyarch has offered nothing really new in regards to the campaign. At times it can feel boring as there is little enemy variety and challenge. Most enemies are bullet sponges on higher difficulties and it soon feels like a chore to finish the current mission.<br />

However, there is variety on how to approach missions. With fully customisable load-outs, perks and abilities, there are endless ways to adjust the play style for each mission. At first, the cybernetic abilities are interesting. These abilities allow players to hack or destroy enemies in different ways, on the fly, once fully charged. They quickly lose their charm when using a gun has more effect in later stages of the game. <br />

Black Ops 3 feels like it pulls players from one objective to the next, in typical action movie style. Yet, the game is far from memorable compared to previous entries in the series as it is missing the magic that they had.
