The game takes place in that iconic little town known as Arcadia Bay. It&#039;s set a few years before the original season, in &lt;i&gt;BTS,&lt;/i&gt; Chloe is sixteen years old and struggling to cope with the recent loss of her father. Her hair isn&#039;t dyed blue yet but we are witnessing first hand the birth of the rebellious spirit that many gamer&#039;s came to love.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plot of the episode primarily focuses on Chloe&#039;s troubles at school and at home. Her soon to be step father David has come in to the picture and he is trying to set straight the tameless Chloe Price. It is here where we take control of Chloe, sneaking out to go see a punk rock show, indulging in cannabis usage and being generally directionless. Chloe is so unhappy and Deck Nine manage to convey her emotional destruction with so much more clarity than in the original season.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;We finally start to understand why she is the way she is. Max left her. Her father died. She is failing school and has no friends left.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is, until we meet the famous character known as Rachel Amber. We never saw her in the first season so this is her official introduction into &lt;i&gt;LIS&lt;/i&gt;, and boy, do they nail her character. This first episode perfectly encapsulates what is wrong in Chloe&#039;s life while also introducing the person that we know will have a lasting impact on her. There are emotional moments that hit players where it hurts, but there are also calmer moments. Moments where we can breathe in the world and give Chloe momentarily relief, a tranquil moment amidst the storm.&lt;/p&gt;
