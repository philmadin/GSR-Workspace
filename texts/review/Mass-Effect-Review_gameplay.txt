A third person shooter, something of a fetish at the time of its release, <i>Mass Effect</i> is rough, but engaging. Players control Commander Shepard, a member of the Alliance Military. You assign a class to yourself and based on the class you have certain abilities.&nbsp;<p><br></p><p><br></p><p>A Soldier focuses on weapon mastery whilst a Biotic focuses on telekinetic powers that can throw, lift and disrupt your enemies. Your allies are also at your beck and call with their own set of abilities that can be used at your whim.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The direct combat is a little wonky with harder difficulties being a horrible slog through near immune enemies. Over time you level up, improving upon your abilities and finding new gear that turns the tide. However, the inventory system is complex and convoluted with item management a tedious process.Conversations are held through a series of dialogue options in a wheel. Being nice to people provides Paragon points whilst being a jerk leads to Renegade points. Something of a staple now for Bioware, the system is basic, but easy to use.</p>
