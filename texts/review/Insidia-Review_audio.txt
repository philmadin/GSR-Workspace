With only two background music tracks on loop in the beta version, it&#039;s quite comforting that the battles are quick and exhilarating. The music genre still works well with the gaming experience. I hope they develop more well suited music for the game soon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voice and other sound effects are also an appealing factor in the game.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
