&lt;p&gt;The gameplay is the real star of this game. As you travel down river, you&#039;ll find camps, churches, farms, and other places to scrounge for items that are vital for your survival. You can craft items from what you find to help you better survive the elements and any injuries you might sustain. Everything can be cured, and as long as you know what you&#039;re looking for, you&#039;ll do a decent job of surviving.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is an aspect of RNG to the game so that you&#039;ll never find the same items in the spot twice. This definitely builds on the survival aspect of the game and while it may feel unfair at times, it forces you to think on your feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Death is somewhat permanent in this game. When you die you either start right back at the beginning, or you can choose to continue from a checkpoint if you reached one. Aesop also comes back with whatever he was carrying from your last run-through, which in a game like this one is a small mercy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, you might find that you end up dying more often than not because of how easy it is. You could die of starvation or dehydration or drowning due to lack of food, water, or your raft being destroyed. You can also be attacked by wild animals while you&#039;re crafting items or reading something. Scaring the animals and running away is an option but if you&#039;re not careful, you&#039;ll end up falling victim to them instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleeping seems to the only time when you&#039;re truly safe, but hunger and hydration are still both concerns you need to be mindful of.&lt;/p&gt;
