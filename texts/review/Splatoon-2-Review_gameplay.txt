As expected from a multiplayer game, its the gameplay where &lt;i&gt;Splatoon 2 &lt;/i&gt;truly shines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For those unfamiliar, &lt;i&gt;Splatoon&lt;/i&gt; is a unique take on the third person shooter. Instead of bullets, you shoot ink - and at its most basic core, you need to cover the arena in your team&#039;s ink, whilst blasting anyone that gets in your way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#039;s more; pressing the LR trigger turns your Inkling kid into a squid, which lets you swim through your paint - along floors, and even up walls. This also refills your tank, whilst allowing you to ambush foes, and leap instantly to where the heart of the action is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#039;s this simple system that has created such a huge following, and Nintendo have refined it to the nth degree for the sequel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you&#039;re new to the game, I recommend playing through the Hero Mode. Not only is it fun blasting the Octarians and finding hidden items, it also teaches you the basics of the game, as well as how each weapon handles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When you&#039;re ready, you can choose from three different multiplayer modes via the funky Inkopolis square; a hub area that houses shops to deck out your Inkling in clothing, weapons, stat-boosting snacks and even an arcade rhythm game. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Initially, you&#039;ll only be able to choose from Regular Turf battles, with shops open once you hit level four, and Ranked battles when you reach level 10. When you hit the Ranked circuit, you can then enter the super-pro League battles - though I personally haven&#039;t made it this far yet! Modes like Rainmaker, Splatzone and Tower Control are basically variations of traditional shooter modes, but are no less fun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, there&#039;s the aforementioned Salmon Run - a frantic two to four player mode which gives you a random weapon, as you endure three waves of terrifying fish monsters! This is also playable in local couch multiplayer, which is an awesome addition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are a swathe of new weapons, including the Clash Blaster, the Flingza Roller, Dualies and Goo Tuber, as well as returning faves - and all special weapon attacks are brand new. There are eight stages (two returning and six new), ensuring that players are on new ground when it comes to battling!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, we have Amiibo functionality, with new figures being released alongside the game. With these, you can save your custom Inkling and take it over to a friend&#039;s Switch, as well as unlock new gear!&lt;br&gt;
