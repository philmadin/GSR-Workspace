In a game where you routinely find yourself running through varying environments, it would be detrimental to your survival rate if you were to say that audio makes no difference. The thing that makes &lt;i&gt;PUBG&lt;/i&gt; so refreshing and unique is the meticulous attention that has been paid to the audio.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the smallest detail, like how all of the cars sound like they&#039;re about to break down at any time, to no matter where yo&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;u are, you can hear and estimate the direction of any gunshot because of the direction audio system in the game. Bluehole Studios has made it so that &lt;/span&gt;no&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;matter what your plan is, you will always be able to hear your impending doom.&lt;/span&gt;
