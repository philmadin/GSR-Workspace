On the run from a corporation of some sorts, you are a clone with a limited memory of past events. With nothing but a ship and an AI buddy, you will &#039;live, learn, die, repeat&#039; to uncover who you are and what lead you to this point. Given that roguelikes seldom have a story to them, this is quite a clever way of implementing a plausible storyline, and uses well-spoken narrative and beautifully stylised cut scenes to tell it.
