<br>On the whole, the graphics are a mixed bag. The art style is simply beautiful, as it evokes the ancient crumbling aesthetic of its predecessors. Environments are lush; particularly the greenery and water effects, but the real star of the show is Trico himself.<br><br>Possibly the most impressive creature I've ever witnessed in a game, he really does seem like a living, breathing animal. As someone who has been surrounded by animals my entire life, I really marveled at the nuances in his behaviour - from the playful batting of his food, to the lip-quivering when he's scared - he really made the experience worthwhile, and I must applaud the programmers and artists for their undoubted talent.<br><br>Nevertheless, there are issues. The game's PS3 background is apparent, with blurry textures evident, and the boy himself looking like an HD PS2 character model. There was also much ballyhoo over the framerate on the original PS4 hardware (as opposed to the stable PS4 Pro version), though I personally didn't have much of an issue. Playing on a PS4 Slim, frame drops were frequent, but they weren't enough to ruin my time.<br><br>
