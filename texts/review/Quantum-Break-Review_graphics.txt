The graphics of this game are fantastic. There are some blemishes and glitches here and there, but Remedy have pulled a cheeky 'Assassin's Creed', and have attributed these quirks to the decay of time. Oh well, whatever works, I suppose.&nbsp;<p><br></p><p>Either way, character models are fantastic, with incredibly realistic faces, and environments are super detailed. Really superb work. Unfortunately, the PC version has suffered a litany of issues, though hopefully they'll be fixed soon enough.</p>
