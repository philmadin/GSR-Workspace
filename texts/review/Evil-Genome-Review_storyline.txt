The story of &lt;i&gt;Evil Genome &lt;/i&gt;follows Lachesis, an augmented human (or so we think), who after a crash landing finds that she has no memory of who or where she is. Most of the story takes place underground in caves and tunnels, and has you interacting with what remains of humanity on this toxic planet. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The story feels drawn out and boring at times, which makes completing the game a chore instead of a joy. Though there are some high points, this reviewer personally doesn&#039;t feel that is enough to keep most players engaged. &lt;br&gt;
