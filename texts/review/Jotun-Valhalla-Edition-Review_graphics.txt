<br>In a word; stunning. As you can see from the screens, <i>Jotun</i> is one striking videogame. Using a brilliant, hand-drawn method of animation, Thunder Lotus Games have truly outdone themselves in terms of taking advantage of the gaming medium. Undoubtedly harder and more taxing than simply using CGI, the care and attention is immediately apparent, with the entire game looking like a cartoon.<br><br>Add this to the fantastical Norse imagery (a perfect subject) and it's clear that <i>Jotun</i> is one of the best looking games I've ever played. Without giving too much away, levels are stunningly varied, from grassy barrows, to dwarven cities, and black swamps - and entering each of them had me bursting with anticipation.<br><br>The bosses themselves also benefit greatly from this visual style; their designs both beautiful and terrifying in equal measure. Fantastic!<br>
