In Conan Exiles you must build, craft, consume and battle your way across Hyboria. It&#039;s pretty standard stuff but it&#039;s done fairly well. The crafting system, construction, combat and survival elements are all things you&#039;ve seen before; be it in DayZ, ARK or any other multiplayer open world survival games that are all the rage these days.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There isn&#039;t really anything that stands out as a whole, but the summonable avatars, enormous entities earned by gathering favour with your chosen god, are certainly something new. Outside of this, there&#039;s nothing super special going on. It&#039;s competently assembled to be sure, however running around, drinking water, eating various raw meat, build rudimentary structures and hacking and AI and players alike has all been done before.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately it isn&#039;t all good. If, for some obscure reason that you&#039;d want to play with a friend; enjoy jumping on an awful official server that, when it isn&#039;t crashing, is either being wiped or disappearing altogether.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there is the option of hosting your own game through creating your own server, the system for this is awful. It restricts players other than the host to a set distance from the host, totally negating the games open-world. If I could easily set up a server that allowed myself and everyone else to roam free, I would. As it stands I mostly play solo on account of awful connectivity and abysmal support.&lt;/p&gt;
