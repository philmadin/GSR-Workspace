&lt;i&gt;Life Is Strange&lt;/i&gt; was one of the most popular and critically acclaimed titles of 2015. Two years later and we have a prequel featuring fan favourite Chloe Price as the protagonist. &lt;i&gt;Before The Storm&lt;/i&gt; does everything a good prequel needs to do. It strengthens the original series by tenfold while still continuing to be an amazing adventure in its own right. There is no other game that captures the struggle of adolescence quite like this series does. Fans of both&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;LIS &lt;/i&gt;and outstanding storytelling can rejoice, for&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Before The Storm&lt;/i&gt; is one of the best single player experiences of 2017.
