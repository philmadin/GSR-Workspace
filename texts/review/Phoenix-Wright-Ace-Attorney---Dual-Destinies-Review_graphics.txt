&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dual Destinies&lt;/i&gt; is the first game in the series to upgrade from sprites to 3D models. Along with the orchestrated soundtrack, it brings a totally different feel than previous games. Most of the models are spot on but some, like Trucy and Klavier, look a bit off.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also for the first time in the series, there are anime cutscenes. It&#039;s great to finally see the characters animated and alive and it brings a fresh perspective to some scenes. The English voice acting, however, leaves something to be desired.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
