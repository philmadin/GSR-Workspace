The mechs, their weapons and abilities, enemies, everything sounds as mechanical and loaded with gears. The whir of your machine gun, the sounds of explosions being detonated around your mech are exciting and add that extra level of interactivity. Sound helps you to analyse your situation and status. Warning sirens inside your cockpit whining as youâ€™re attempting to thruster out of the way of explosives whilst also taking bullet fire is tense, but enjoyable.
