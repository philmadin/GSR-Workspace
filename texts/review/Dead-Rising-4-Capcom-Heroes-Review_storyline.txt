The story is pretty much the same over-the-top zombie killing fun that you received in the base game, only this time some unknown forces have imbued Frank West with the power to become some of Capcom&#039;s greatest heroes (like X from Megaman, Ryu and Cammy from Street Fighter, Jill Valentine from Resident Evil, and my personal favorite, Dante from Devil May Cry).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With that being said, Capcom Heroes injects a new sense of adventure and hilarity into a game which quite frankly tends to get boring after a while. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Watching somewhat serious character driven cutscenes while dressed at M. Bison really helps drive the player along the somewhat boring parts of the game, and the addition of costume challenges along the way really keeps this from being a game that you would only pick up once.&lt;br&gt;
