The story is a perfectly paced emotional journey that sees Sebastian struggle with his inner demons and past failures in the beginning of the game. By the end it sees him come to terms with his past and slowly returns to the old badass Sebastian we all love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Evil Within 2&lt;/i&gt; rolls smoothly off of the first game, resolving the loose ends left behind and leaving some answers untold in hopes of being answered in the inevitable DLC.&lt;br&gt;
