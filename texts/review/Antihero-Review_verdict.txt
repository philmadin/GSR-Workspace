Antihero is a fun, playful game in a genre that at times can feel a bit stuffy and to some people boring. It blends a unique art style with a serious soundtrack but doesn&#039;t bear down on you. Gameplay is challenging but fun, it makes you have to go into every map with a plan, as going without could spell your doom. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I enjoyed Antihero because it breathes new life into a genre which for me personally was boring and stagnant. I feel that Antihero will appeal to a lot of casual gamers and mobile gamers as you don&#039;t have to spend half a day working on one game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Antihero is the complete package needed to bring the turn-based strategy genre back from the depths of public interest, in my opinion.&lt;br&gt;
