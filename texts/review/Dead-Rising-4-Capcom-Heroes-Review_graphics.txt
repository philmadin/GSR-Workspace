Graphically, Capcom Heroes is the same winter wonderland that the base game is, part holiday shopping paradise and part horrifying monster mash of mangled zombies akin to the early (and good) seasons of The Walking Dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although, it is made better by the game giving you the ability to run around the zombie hordes dressed as Ryu and handing out Christmas presents in the form of Hadoukens, or as Zombie Frank West literally &#039;hitting on&#039; the ladies, trying to get more than just their number.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
