The game plays like a dream. There are multiple approaches to a situation in &lt;i&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/i&gt;. Stealth is the safest approach by remaining unseen by using traps and disarms to take down enemies. The other way is to go in with arrows flying, dodging and using the machines against themselves. Learning their weaknesses and exploiting them is the main focus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aloy learns new skills that increase her abilities in and out of combat. Waypoints and questmarkers do spoil you in this game, but thankfully, can be switched off for an increased difficulty. This game is a collectors dream with plenty of items to find, upgrade and craft to achieve completion. &lt;br&gt;
