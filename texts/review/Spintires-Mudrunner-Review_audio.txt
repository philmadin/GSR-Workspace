The only good thing to say about the audio is the sound that the mud makes. There&#039;s next to no music aside from a short rock riff whenever you start the game or complete an objective, and the engines do tend to drone when you&#039;re doing 10km/h for extended periods of time. My tip? Have your own music playing in the background.
