The visuals for &lt;i&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/i&gt; are simply incredible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#039;s hard enough to believe this game runs on the tiny Switch - let alone the Wii U. The art style is a gorgeous continuation of &lt;i&gt;Skyward Sword&#039;s&lt;/i&gt; cel-shading (the bright colours making details easier to spot, according to Nintendo), and there are technical details that simply shouldn&#039;t be possible on such modest hardware.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#039;m talking a gigantic world with no wasted space - everything is there for a reason, and every square inch contains a point of interest. There&#039;s a full physics system that influences the way the game is played, with every object having its own weight and effect, enemies (and Link) flopping like rag dolls and tools that can pick up metal objects, freeze them in place and create ice platforms in the water.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#039;s a dynamic destruction engine, with fire that spreads realistically (whether through grass, wood or even cooking food), trees that fall, and electricity that can be conducted by steel and water. There&#039;s even an advanced lightning engine that should&#039;ve been impossible on Wii U, with real-time global illumination giving off water reflections and sunlight that bounces off grass and wet dirt. There&#039;s even a next-gen sky, with moving clouds and storms!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, all of this causes some stress on performance. Framerates can drop pretty bad in very busy moments, like big battles or towns - and I even encountered some freezes in a few instances (only split second ones). It&#039;s nothing that ruins the experiences, and I can forgive such hiccups, considering everything else going on. Also, it runs at 720p on Wii U, 900p on Switch (and 720p in&amp;nbsp;portable mode, which is actually the smoothest way to play).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
