The basic gameplay in &lt;i&gt;iO&lt;/i&gt; is relatively simple. You essentially have four controls: left and right, which makes your ball move forward and backwards, and up and down, which causes your ball to grow bigger and smaller.&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You use these co&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;ntrols in various combinations to navigate through a set of obstacles and reach the goal that&#039;s placed somewhere on the level. If you get to the goal in a fast enough time, you&#039;ll get a gold medal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With obstacles such as moving platforms, portals, and platforms you can&#039;t touch, you&#039;ll definitely need to think about what you need to do in order to reach the goal.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you&#039;ll be climbing up walls, other times you&#039;ll be launching yourself from a platform. You might get lucky sometimes but often you&#039;ll be trying again and again before you actually reach the goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
