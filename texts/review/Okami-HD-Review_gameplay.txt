The gameplay is what you&#039;d expect from a remastered game, everything is essentially the same as it was back in 2006. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A mix of hack and slash mechanics and brush mechanics really sets &lt;i&gt;Okami HD &lt;/i&gt;apart from the pack (pun intended) because this game is a case of everything that you learn helps to shape and cleanse the surprisingly open world around you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only downside to the game is that rather begrudgingly, the camera controls (which feel like piloting a tank through quicksand) from the original have been carried over. Running around the world, and completing puzzles becomes truly a chore to complete, marring an otherwise fun and engaging game. &lt;br&gt;
