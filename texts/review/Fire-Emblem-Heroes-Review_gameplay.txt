&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The gameplay is basic Fire Emblem, but more streamlined and designed for players unfamiliar with the series. The trademark &#039;Permadeath&#039; is omitted, as well as the Support feature.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;Weapon and item shops are also gone,with each character able to wield a limited number of weapons (determined by their default class).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;The map is also considerably smaller, with only four maximum characters available to you. This does result in a simpler, and all around easier game, but better suits the mobile platform.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Despite the fun and engaging gameplay, the micro-transaction features somewhat stifle the game&#039;s potential. In order to recruit new characters to your cause, you must earn and trade orbs. When beginning the campaign,you are given a seemingly generous amount of orbs, but they do not last.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;For each main quest victory, you are awarded one orb. A new (randomly assigned) character costs five orbs. Three orbs cost $2.99 AUS, and if you want to collect every character in the game, you will most likely have to resort to paying for them. The game also implements a stamina system, which limits how long you can play.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;To play a match it costs stamina points. You can replenish your stamina metre with items, taking a break from play, or by spending orbs. This may not bother those who only play a few matches a day, but may prove to alienate those who wish to spend extended time levelling up their characters.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
