It&#039;s a great sequel in every sense - the gameplay, audio, and overall graphics have seen a major improvement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The story started out like it was going to be another jump-scare-filled &quot;horror&quot; game, but very quickly turned into an emotional journey that had me laughing, hiding in fear, and by the end almost crying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The good news for myself and other fans is that judging by the loose ends that were left behind, this is not the end of &lt;i&gt;The Evil Within&lt;/i&gt; story. At least for now. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
