The gameplay has seen an all around improvement on the first game&#039;s janky mechanics, the shooting feels sharper, the flying is smoother, and the vehicles are actually drive-able. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aside from some problems with the loot crate and balancing controversies that have marred the game since release, the multiplayer is fun and boasts huge player counts on each mode. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only exception is with the Hero versus Hero mode which has become a lot more fun, with the 10v10 format being abandoned like Rey on Jakku, for a more fun and streamlined 4v4 heroes only format. This means that we can finally see Chewbacca get his revenge on Kylo Ren, and that everyone in the game can play as their favorite Star Wars character. &lt;br&gt;
