&lt;i&gt;Speedrunners&#039; &lt;/i&gt;gameplay is (as the title entails) all about speed. Being the fastest is key to winning, but that&#039;s not all. Dodging obstacles and the other players is the only way to keep your place at the front of the pack and making sure not to find yourself at the edge of the frame is paramount to victory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Speedrunners&#039; &lt;/i&gt;fast-paced, edge of your seat gameplay is not only great use of the games limited mechanics, but also is a blast to play.&amp;nbsp;The game&amp;nbsp;kept me on my toes around every bend, the craziness that is the multiplayer had me both cursing and applauding the other players as we all raced around the track carefully planning where to drop our traps to get a better edge on the competition. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
