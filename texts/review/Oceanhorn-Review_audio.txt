<br>The soundtrack is doubtlessly the best aspect of <i>Oceanhorn</i>. There is minimal dialogue or even cutscenes for that matter so the game instead relies on its superb music. Each area has its own vibe and boss battles as you would expect have themes nearly as booming as the bosses themselves. The games composers Kalle Ylitalo, Kenji Ito and Nobuo Uematsu have created a noteworthy score that deserves recognition. Check out the trailer below for a snippet of just how beautiful <i>Oceanhorn's</i> soundtrack really is.&nbsp;
