&lt;i&gt;ZHEROS&lt;/i&gt; can be played in either single player or with a friend in co-op, using a range of melee combinations, hi-tech weapons or parrying attacks by using the shield. &lt;i&gt;ZHEROS&lt;/i&gt; tries to bring the feel of old school beat &#039;em ups to the modern next-gen gaming audience. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To a degree &lt;i&gt;ZHEROS&lt;/i&gt; pulls this off with the use of smooth combo based melee that blends with shield parrying to have combat flow seamlessly along with simple point to fire ranged weapons all making the hordes of enemies easier to deal with than the old school beat &#039;em ups &lt;i&gt;ZHEROS&lt;/i&gt; builds off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only draw back of all this is that there is no real challenge, I was playing on the hardest difficulty and the only time health became a problem, the game sent in a mech suit an it proceeded to clear out all the enemies giving me bother, giving me time to collect some health items and taking all of the challenge out of that level. &lt;br&gt;
