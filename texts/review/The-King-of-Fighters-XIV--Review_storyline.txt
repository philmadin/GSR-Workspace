<br>The storyline for <i>The King of Fighters XIV</i> is very basic, and really not much different to early entries of <i>Street Fighter</i>, <i>Tekken</i> or <i>Mortal Kombat</i>. Basically, big baddie Antonov (who just loves cheating death in every<i> KoF</i> game) stages yet another 'King of Fighters' tournament (not to be confused with <i>Tekken's</i> 'King of the Iron Fist' tournament!), and as a result, many (and I mean <i>many</i>) pugilists from all over the world enter, in order to resolve their personal quests. <br><br><br>Depending on who you bring along with you (fights are three vs. three), dialogues will change, and witty barbs are exchanged, but it's only skin deep. However, it evokes the glorious years of the '90s, and made me feel like I was a kid again, playing one of SNK's awesome arcade games - so that's a big plus in my book!<br>
