<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Changes to <i>Destiny’s</i> core mechanics are primarily a result of updates in between content releases. A lot of the credit for loot accessibility and balance can’t really be pointed at Rise of Iron. That said, those changes are what allow Rise of Iron to swim a little more freely.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">New Exotic quests, one new Strike, one old Strike reborn and a new Raid make for tasty treats indeed. Yet there’s a great deal of focus on what came before. To the point of an entire mission set aside for a run down memory lane. SIVA Fallen, Plaguelands, Archon’s Forge (an arena mimicking Court of Oryx) and old gear redistributed are almost worth grinding your teeth over the lack of creativity.<br></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Masochists intending to live in the Crucible will find a new game type and four maps. Supremacy, a playlist familiar to <i>Call of Duty</i> fans in Kill Confirmed, tries its luck in <i>Destiny</i>. Players drop Engrams on death that can be claimed by friend or foe, scoring points for whoever gets there first. Compared to Rift and Mayhem, Supremacy may struggle to find a lasting fanbase, but for the time being it’s a welcome addition to the setlist.</span></p>
