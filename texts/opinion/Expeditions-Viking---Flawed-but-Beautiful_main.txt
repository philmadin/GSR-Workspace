Both of these promises was fulfilled.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;">Expeditions: Vikings thelatest release from Logic Artists tickled my fancy far more than I was hoping,the best way I could describe it in a sentence would be Vikings meets a hexbased fallout 2, and if you’re anything like me you’re already looking for thecatch because damn that’s too good of a mix. Well unfortunately there is acatch… there are bugs, nothing really game breaking but enough to be prettygoddamn annoying, the worst offender for me is the audio. Even after turningthe audio slider down some areas music keeps going and just gets progressivelylouder until it’s actually oppressive, so much so I had to go into the volumemixer in the desktop to mute the game which means almost all of the voiceacting was lost to me.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;">So it’s rough around theedges, so why don’t I just prattle on for a few hundred more words call it a reviewand go back to watching Last Kingdom? Because Expeditions: Vikings is part ofthe old school RPG comeback that’s been happening for a few years, but wherePillars of Eternity and Torment Tides of Numenara are bringing back gameplay,Vikings truly hits that story freedom I haven’t felt since Fallout: New Vegas.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;">You play a Theign – a chieftainof a small and rather desolate village who’s former chieftan (your father) waspretty terrible at his job. After discovering that another theign is eying upyour territory you’re only hope to prove your worthy to keep your lands is tobuild a boat and go to that rich stuck up neighbour called Britain and startredistributing all that wealth. From there you have a few paths to take,trading via opening trade routes, buying and selling resources and collectingpeople with certain skills will grow your village, maybe secure an alliancewith one of the two kingdoms there to assure you’re security, or just pillagethe shit out of them and invade.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;">All throughout yourcompanions react extremely to almost every choice you make, keeping everyonehappy while technically possible is a 40 hour task in of itself. The landscapedoes change to your actions, and there is quite a bit of prep work that can bedone for you to capitalise on or let slide. In one play through I was gettingset to be the Picts new best friend, a few choices later I find an opportunity Icouldn’t pass up and utilise the invasion point I had ready to go to begin atotal invasion campaign because, well screw it I’m a Viking. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;">It’s hard to really sellVikings for some people it’s a bit retro, for others it’s a little too indie, butif you love a story that really reacts to you and a damn good love letter to agrand historical time period, then I have to say you should really, really giveExpeditions: Vikings a chance… Fuck Northumbria<o:p></o:p></span></p>
