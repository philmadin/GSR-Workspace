<br><b>Biggest Surprise</b><br><br>As an old school Nintendo/SEGA fan, the announcement of <i>Sonic Mania</i> had me blubbering like the very best of manchildren. A spiritual sequel to the Mega Drive/Genesis games of yore, seeing the blue blur whiz around in 16-bit glory reminded me that travesties like <i>Sonic '06</i> and <i>Sonic Boom</i> were not the final nails in the spiny speedster's coffin. Note to SEGA - more of <i>this</i>, and less of Shadow the presidential assassin, and human/hedgehog bestiality. <i>Sonic</i> is at its best when it's colourful and cheery!<br><br><br><b>Biggest Disappointment</b><br><br>Oh Nintendo,why do you hurt me so? Remember when <i>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</i> (then known as <i>Zelda Wii U</i>) would be released in 2015? Those were the good old days. Originally promised back then, Nintendo <i>then</i> promised it would be out in 2016, before <i>super-duper </i>promising that it will make it to store shelves in 2017. What hurt even more was that the gut-punch news of <i>Zelda's</i> continued-stewing was followed by the double whammy that it would be the only game playable at Nintendo's E3, and that the mysterious 'NX' would be absent entirely. Thankfully though, things have turned out pretty well...<br><br><br><b>2017 Most Anticipated</b><br><br>... because <i>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</i> looks absolutely - ahem - <i>breathtaking</i>. The most open entry in the venerated franchise since the original, <i>Breath of the Wild</i> has the very real potential to be one of the best videogames of all time, and could finally be the one that dethrones <i>Ocarina of Time</i> as my favourite. I can spend all day listing why; the beautiful visuals, the gigantic world, the total freedom to do as you please, the survival elements - but there's another big thing in 2017 the has me foaming with excitement.<br><br>The Nintendo Switch. Whilst 2016 was one of Nintendo's driest, 2017 promises the start of something great. <i>Zelda</i> will be the last big game for Wii U, but will also one of the first for the Switch. We'll learn more about the console in January, but everything shown so far points to a product that has learned from Wii U's failure. A product that seems to be challenging home consoles, handhelds <i>and</i> smart devices, will the Switch uproot the industry once more, just as the Wii and DS did? We'll know in a few more months...<br><br><br><b>2016 Game of the Year</b><br><br><i>Dragon Quest VII: Fragments of the Forgotten Past</i>. It's crazy to think that one of the biggest and best games of this year is a handheld game that was originally released 15 years ago - but that's exactly what we got. Never released in PAL territories (hence, me never being able to play it), <i>DQVII</i> reminded me of games like <i>Super Mario RPG</i> and <i>Earthbound</i>; white whales that took their sweet time making it to Europe and Oceania, but were totally worth the wait. Taking Square-Enix an incredible three years to localise, <i>Fragments of the Forgotten Past</i> is truly an epic adventure; one that relishes in its old-school JRPG mechanics, bright and goofy aesthetic, and big-band soundtrack that has made <i>Dragon Quest</i> so unapologetically <i>uncool</i> - it automatically makes it <i>totally</i> cool. It's these things that have made the series so timeless, and I cannot wait for the tradition to continue in <i>Dragon Quest XI</i>!<br><br>
