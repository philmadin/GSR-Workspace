<br><b>Caution. This article contains spoilers for the <i>Modern Warfare</i> Trilogy.</b><br><br>The<i> Modern Warfare</i> trilogy wears its inspiration proudly. From <i>The Rock</i> to <i>Black Hawk Down</i>. From <i>Red Dawn </i>to <i>Cliffhanger</i>, there's barely an inch of the series that doesn't draw from Hollywood action. It plays like a Michael Bay movie, one of the good ones that is. Guns, explosions, global threats, there's nothing left untouched by the action.<br><br>Over the course of three games we are treated to spectacles like nothing else. Escaping sinking ships, liberating the White House, watching the Eiffel Tower fall, they're all moments one would expect to see in an action movie from the '80s or '90s. <br><br><i>Modern Warfare 1</i> gave us notes of <i>Black Hawk Down. </i>Fighting Middle Eastern foes while riding around on helicopters, before inevitably rescuing a pilot following a crash. Charlie Don't Surf is an <i>Apocalypse Now </i>nod and No Fighting in the War Room referencing <i>Dr Strangelove</i>. The epilogue of the game clearly calls back to the likes of <i>Air Force One</i>.<br><br><i>Modern Warfare 2</i> fully embraced it's Hollywood roots, with moments torn straight from <i>The Rock </i>and <i>Red Dawn</i>. The Russian invasion of a small American town, a level simply titled Wolverines and green flares waving off an air-strike. The third mission of the game is called <i>Cliffhanger</i>, a direct link to the Sylvester Stallone film of the same name. The shower shootout in an isolated prison is more than a little inspired by Michael Bay's <i>The Rock</i>.<br><br><i>Modern Warfare 3</i>, while not drawing as heavily on existing material, certainly plays like something out of the '80s. From fighting through Wall Street to crashing the Russian president's plane. Chasing trains through the London underground to invading a re-purposed fortress in Prague. One minute you're tearing through Sierra Leone,&nbsp; the next your pushing the Russian army out of Hamburg, before fighting your way through a diamond mine. It all culminates in an ending that feels ripped from an Arnold Schwarzenegger film. The villain is hung from his own helicopter after a crash into a hotel, the hero sitting below him, smoking a cigar as sirens approach from the distance. <br><br>Despite receiving a lot&nbsp; of criticism across the years, with ever diminishing scores, <i>Call of Duty</i> still has something to offer. While far too many people ignore the campaign, preferring to focus on the multiplayer aspects, the story mode of the <i>Modern Warfare </i>trilogy is one of the best single player experiences available. It's explosive, exciting and torn straight from the pages of Hollywood. If you enjoy a good action movie then take the plunge and play one, it's definitely worth it.<br><br>
