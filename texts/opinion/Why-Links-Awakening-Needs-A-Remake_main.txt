2016 will be an exciting time for fans of The Legend of Zelda franchise. Not only will we finally play Zelda Wii U, Nintendo is tiding us over until then with a Twilight Princess HD rerelease, pencilled in for March 2016. Arguably one of the darkest yet strangest games in the series, Twilight Princess is a standout in the franchise. <br />
With Twilight Princess being the fourth title in the series to receive a HD update, fans may consider other possible titles that may receive a rerelease in the future.  A strong, but often overlooked contender is Link’s Awakening.<br />
<br />
Why Link’s Awakening? As the first Zelda game to shake up the story’s formula, this classic definitely deserves an update. For the first time, there was no Ganon, no Triforce, no Hyrule – hell, there wasn’t even a princess named Zelda. Instead, the game revolved entirely around Link, as he gets shipwrecked on a mysterious island called Koholint. Upon waking, he must quest to awaken its divine guardian, the Wind Fish, in order to return home. However the island is not all that it seems. The more the player finds out about Koholint, the more it turns the meaning of the game upside down and changes your perception of it. Before Link’s Awakening, Zelda had never even attempted stories or themes as profound as what is in this instalment.<br />
<br />
It’s no secret that modern systems like the Nintendo 3DS could do justice to the island’s zany atmosphere. The original Game Boy release (and its colour 'DX' version pictured) pulled it off impressively with relatively basic 8-bit technology. A touch of the 3DS magic, however, would give Koholint the modern spark it needs, bringing its strangeness to life for a modern audience. <br />
Link’s Awakening featured some of the wackiest and surreal characters in Zelda history, from a mushroom-obsessed, man-child father (who even turns into a raccoon at one point), an anthropomorphic crocodile who is obsessed with bananas and even, in the DX version, a mouse photographer. Amongst an island where telephone booths exist incongruously in its otherwise technologically underdeveloped environment, where Mario creatures such as Chain Chomps, Goombas and Piranha Plants reside, the game is strangely inconsistent – and yet, its inconsistency is what drives its weird and fascinating quality.<br />
Such fascinating weirdness makes Koholint a place well worth a HD remake, to see how revolutions in 3D graphics can bring this world to life for the modern generation.<br />
<br />
As far as gameplay goes, the game is as solid as any Zelda that came before or after. It proved that the level design on a technologically limited handheld could contest with the console Zelda games. Puzzle-solving was as fun and engaging as ever and the bosses memorable – who could forget throwing a genie bottle against the walls with your power bracelets, or the giant liquid blob that you had to shake off the ceiling by using your Pegasus boots against the walls? The battles are seldom frustrating and a ton of fun. For this to be remade in glorious 3D would be a treat for those who have played it and those unfamiliar with it.<br />
<br />
Link’s Awakening is a treat to play and truly deserves a remake for the modern generation. Similar to how A Link Between Worlds was like a tribute to A Link to the Past, a remake of Link’s Awakening would be the perfect tribute to the game’s legacy. So, come on, Nintendo - how about giving Link's Awakening some HD love?<br />
