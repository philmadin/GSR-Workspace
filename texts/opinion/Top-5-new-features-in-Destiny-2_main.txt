We here at game Shark Reviews were fans of 2014's <i>Destiny</i> and everything it did to change the somewhat stale the first person shooter genre. So we thought that since <i>Destiny 2 </i>is just around the corner (for consoles at least), we would countdown the Top five new features in<i> Destiny 2.</i><br><br>*Disclaimer* <br>These are the five new features that we believe are the best additions to <i>Destiny 2.</i><br><br><b>5. Crucible changes</b><br><i>- Line up you best 4 up, and hopefully the others fall first</i><br><i>Destiny 2</i> has done away with the 6v6, 3v3, and 2v2 of <i>Destiny</i> and made all PvP encounters in this revamped Crucible will now be 4v4. <b><i>Bungie</i></b> made these changes because they want to focus more on smaller team competitive gameplay, and on better all around map design on all around.<br>With what feels like every shooter focusing on smaller teams in competitive play, this could be a step in the right direction for the <i>Destiny </i>series as smaller teams could make for more strategic gameplay from all the players on the battlefield.<br><br><b>4. New matchmaking</b><br><i>- Now with a 90% chance to find our perfect match</i><br><i>Destiny 2</i> overall has a huge focus on teams or clans as they are known,and that is especially shown in the new matchmaking system. <i>Destiny 2</i> will feature what <b><i>Bungie </i></b>is describing as "a more optimal way of matchmaking" called "Guided Games", Guide Games will allow players to search for clans which may be in need of an additional player to help with Raids or Strikes.<br>The new matchmaking system should save players from having to spend heaps of time in orbit, waiting for the game to match them with other players.<br><br><b>3. 4 New worlds</b><br><i>- Not just one Whole New World</i><br><i>Destiny 2</i> has 4 (Technically 3) new worlds for players to romp around on, in their PvE adventures. The 4 (3) new worlds that make up <i>Destiny 2</i> are Titan (Saturn's moon), Io (Jupiter's moon), Nessus, and Earth's European Dead Zone (which in 2014's Destiny was a PvP only map), all of these worlds will have their own unique Raids and Strikes for players to bolster their ranks and continue along their journey.<br><br><b>2. New Subclasses</b><br><i>- Avengers assemb... Oh Right</i><br>While <i>Destiny 2</i> isn't getting any new classes, all of the subclasses from 2014's <i>Destiny</i> are making a return as well&nbsp; 3 new subclasses players can enjoy which are Titian Sentinel, Hunter Arcstrider, and Warlock Dawnblade. <br>Here is a brief rundown of the highlights of these new subclasses do (that's right a list within a list I can it Listception)<br><br>Titan Sentinel essentially makes you Destiny's version of Captain America (minus the 70 year ice bath), giving you the ability to beat up enemies with and then throw your shield at them in order to complete the objective.<br>Hunter Arcstrider is replacing the Bladedancer subclass from Destiny. Arcstrider's super gives your character a larger rate of mobility and an electric staff which you can use to shock your enemies into submission ( as well as a nightmare of a power bill).<br>Warlock Dawnblade is replacing the Warlock Sunsinger, giving players the ability to throw down an AOE healing pit for your team to feast on. Dawnblade's best feature is the super which gives you a sword, with which you can lay down the hottest DPS of the Summer.<br><br>Finally number one, I'm sure that anyone wh is new to the Destiny series will love this as it was a sticking point of Destiny's first year.<br><br><b>1. Destiny 2 has a story </b><br><i>-Now with less pay walls (I hope)</i><br>Now before the <i>Destiny</i> veterans get mad at me for this entry and say that <i>Destiny </i>had a story, i am talking about a story that is not hidden behind a pay wall. <b><i>Bungie</i></b> has made sure that they do not repeat<i> Destiny</i> 2014's mistake and now have no proper story in the base game, insuring that <i>Destiny 2 </i>has story that the player doesn't have to pay for two expansions to receive. <br>This is a huge positive for those players who were burned by the first <i>Destiny, </i>in that now they have a story that they may sink their teeth into. <br><br>Thank you for reading this list, if you enjoyed it let us know by liking the article and don't hesitate to tell us if you have a list idea either in the comments, Facebook or Twitter<br>
