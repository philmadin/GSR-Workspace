You've seen it written on every review, every article, and every Facebook post since it was released - Just Cause 3 is a buggy mess. The current consensus is that it's playable for most people, but you're one good review away from buying it and the Internet just isn't telling you how playable it really is. Here is a comprehensive inside look at exactly what the issues are, and how they affect gameplay.<br />
<br />
This article covers PC and Playstation 4 versions of the game, although Xbox One is supposedly the worst platform overall for handling Just Cause 3 at this stage.<br />
<br />
On first launch, the first (minor) problem is the length of the title screen - on PC, the first screen you see after the logos can purportedly remain on screen for up to four minutes. This is the screen before the actual loading screen which has tips to keep you entertained. The second loading screen has always been less than 40 seconds for me personally, averaging around 15 seconds. (This may be different depending on your internet speeds - I am having these problems in online mode, over a VPN, in Australia. It’s almost the slowest internet available.)<br />
<br />
On PS4, the first screen has a shorter load time but the loading screen afterwards takes much longer, with my offline tests taking roughly one minute each time. The PS4 has a different notable problem, however - laggy maps.<br />
<br />
It may also be worth mentioning that there is a high score system for things like who can skydive for the longest or jump a car the furthest, and it does not work quite right. I’ve been in the top five for essentially every one of the records, and I know there are a lot more people playing whose scores aren’t appearing in my game.<br />
<br />
The map screen itself on the PS4 takes up to 30 seconds to load icons and province borders, and has quite a low frame rate while navigating around it. This is not an issue I've noticed at all on PC, at any graphics settings, although sometimes the mouse calibration on the map screen is way off. This lag is particularly strange considering that the PS4 has no trouble running the game itself at between 30 and 60 FPS without stuttering through most gameplay.<br />
<br />
As noted in Kotaku's article about JC3's performance, the only stuttering or major lag in the gameplay itself is when the physics engine has to work harder. Obviously, this is usually during massive explosions involving multiple objects and other crazy physics experiments. This is an issue on all consoles, which is a let-down considering that massive explosions involving multiple objects and other crazy physics experiments are a key part of the Just Cause formula.<br />
<br />
The frame rate throughout gameplay is fairly unpredictable so far. Many have reported no issue with a constant 60 FPS, some have trouble reaching that even with fancy setups, and others have random fluctuations as they play. Fortunately, turning VSync off significantly improves the frame rate by all reports. This goes for all consoles, with PS4 copies being stable at 60 FPS for only a limited number of people. The game has also crashed many times for me and others, on both PS4 and PC. Crashes are random, but are sometimes caused by trying to do two mutually-exclusive things at once.<br />
<br />
So what can we do about it? As stated above, turning VSync off makes a huge difference. I went from ~30 to 60 FPS just doing that, and I was able to improve my graphics settings without slowing it down again. But there’s also other good news. <br />

Avalanche Studios released a statement following the release acknowledging the issues (what a novel idea, WB Games and Rocksteady!) and basically telling us that there’s going to be a patch. It <a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/12/03/just-cause-3-patch-date/">could take a while</a> though, since they need to recreate the issues that users report. If you do experience a bug or glitch, please report it, either through the error interface or through the forums linked in their statement (which can be seen at the above link).<br />

Squeenix also worked with AMD to try and fix some issues in the latest beta driver release. Most users report that the update fixed some of the issues. If you’d like to try it for yourself, it can be downloaded <a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download/desktop?os=Windows%208.1%20-%2064">here</a>.<br />

The important thing to take from this article is that the game is playable. As long as you have a decent machine and you don’t absolutely need 60 FPS, you should be able to experience the game without much trouble.
