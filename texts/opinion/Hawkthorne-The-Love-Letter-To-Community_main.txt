<p>Community, NBC's cult sitcom created by Dan Harmon, aired an episode in Season 3 called 'Digital Estate Planning' set almost entirely in a video game. If you're not a fan, I won't bore you with the details. What you need to know is that throughout the episode, the main characters played through a game called Journey To The Center Of Hawkthorne, which featured some references to characters and locations in the show.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Also, the game exists.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Less than three days after the 2012 episode aired, a Redditor named Derferman told the Community subreddit he was making it into a game. Within a week the game had its own subreddit and the rest is history.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Journey To The Center Of Hawkthorne, the game based on the episode, has since featured on Giant Bomb, The Verge, Collider, and has been endlessly shared among Reddit's Community-related, uhh, communities. And there's a good reason why: attention to detail. The game not only features sprites, sound effects, music, animations, and mechanics from the original episode&nbsp;<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:" times="" new="" roman";mso-fareast-font-family:"ＭＳ="" 明朝";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;mso-ansi-language:en-us;mso-fareast-language:en-us;mso-bidi-language:ar-sa"="">–</span><!--EndFragment-->&nbsp;it now also features a fairly accurate recreation of&nbsp;Greendale Community College, where the show is set, as well as almost every costume, piece of music, and location ever featured on Community.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">After playing through the full version of the game, including levels that weren't shown fully in the episode, the player can access Greendale and the rest of the map. They can explore the entire school, complete quests, meet NPCs from all six seasons, spot references to seemingly every episode, and discover secret passages and doorways to entirely new levels based on stories from the show.</span><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">My personal favourite room is the cafeteria, where Sophie B. Hawkins (who appeared in the episode 'Herstory Of Dance') can be found. Upon talking to her, the player can ask to hear a song, and is given a list of chiptunes of songs that appeared in both the game and the show. If you have a favourite track from the show, you can be sure it will be turned into a chiptune and on that list. (Kudos to Reddit user reddfawks who came up with that section and created the art for it.)</span><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">The game can be frustratingly challenging, and the controls aren't great. But for all its flaws, I have nothing but endless praise for the project which now has 12,000 Reddit subscribers and four years of development behind it, from many contributors of chiptunes, sprites, and animations. As a Community fan who has seen the series multiple times, and a game developer, the entire project is a massive wet dream. The references to the show are endless, and hearing the incidental music including ABBA songs turned into electronic music is exciting every time. It's also worth noting that everyone who watches the original episode instantly wishes that the game is real, so the mere existence of the game is exciting.</span><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">The game is still regularly updated&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">–</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">&nbsp;the last update was released in March according to their Github, which is&nbsp;impressive for a four-year-old game.
