<p></p><p></p><p></p><p><b>Top 5 Casual Smartphone Games – Android</b></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Games have come a long way from their time in arcades and nowadays, it’s easy enough to hop on into the Play Store and be overwhelmed at the sheer number of options before you. With that many games, there’s a good chance there’s something out there for you, you just to have to find it. This list will help narrow down the options by presenting five casual smartphones games that should definitely check out.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Neko Atsume (Free)</b></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Neko Atsume is a cute game developed by Hit-Point for iOS and Android that is based around ‘collecting’ different cats. Depending on the food and toys you put out, you can attract different cats to your yard, with the overall goal of the game being to collect all the mementoes that the kitties give you. Neko Atsume isn’t a game that you’ll play consistently. It’s the type of game that you’d check once every few hours but the cute style and adorable kitties will keep you coming back.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Colour Switch (Free)</b></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Colour Switch is a fun game that revolves around moving a dot through a series of obstacles by tapping the screen. Your dot can jump through the colour you are but will be destroyed by other colours. The main game mode requires a bit of skill to time your jumps through the obstacles but for those who struggle with the main game (like me), there are other modes such as Slide, Climb, and Jump. The pop-up ads might get annoying for those who keep dying and it might lag on some devices but overall it’s a solid game that’s a good timewaster.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Dumb Ways to Die (Free)</b></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>This is a game that was based off a video of the same name that was public service campaign by Metro Trains in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It consists of a series of short mini-games, WarioWare style, that you complete in order to gain points. If you fail to complete the challenges, such as flicking piranhas away from someone’s genitals, they’ll die in a humorous but violent way. It has a cute animation style and the music is catchy and cute as well. It’s a great game to pass the time with and you can even unlock the original video. This game is a great way to provide a safety message and there’s even a sequel.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Flow Free (Free)</b></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Flow Free is a puzzle game where you have a grid and need to connect several dots of the same colour. You need to fill the grid with the lines and while not crossing the lines in the process. If you do it in a certain amount of moves you get a perfect score. It starts off easy with only four or five colours and a 5x5 grid but soon enough, it gets harder, adding more and more colours with larger grids. It’s a good game to test your mental abilities and a nice way to pass the time.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Jetpack Joyride (Free)</b></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Finally, Jetpack Joyride is an endless runner style game by Halfbrick Studios where you play as a man that wears a machine gun as a jetpack. Your goal is to get as far as you can while collecting coins and dodging obstacles. You can change the costume of the character and buy him various upgrades with the coins you collect. There are also several different vehicles you can collect during your runs that give a challenge, such as the Lil' Stomper, Profit Bird, and Crazy Freaking Teleporter. Along with these machines, there are different challenges that you can complete to upgrade your level. The overall look of the game is very nice and it’s easy to pick up and play at any time.&nbsp;</p>
