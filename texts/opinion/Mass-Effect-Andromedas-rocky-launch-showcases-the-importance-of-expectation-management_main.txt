Mass Effect is one of gaming's most beloved and well-renowned series, and it's hard to deny that the original trilogy left a legacy that many remember fondly. The latest entry in the series, Mass Effect: Andromeda, is being received somewhat differently.<p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The first stain upon an otherwise sparkling reputation came at the end of Mass Effect 3, with many players taking to forums and social media to complain about the trilogy's grand finale. Despite the backlash, Mass Effect 3 is widely remembered as an excellent addition to the series in the most part, and received positive reviews across the board.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Unsurprisingly, many fans of the first three games were keenly anticipating the release of the franchise's latest instalment, Mass Effect: Andromeda. A day before the game's official release, however, it seems that the atmosphere amongst gamers is anything but positive.<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">A quick scroll through the messages directed at the official Bioware and Mass Effect Twitter accounts reveals an overwhelming amount of disappointment, frustration, and anger in regards to this newest instalment. Most of the outrage seems to be in regards to Andromeda's facial animations. Many are claiming these animations fall short in comparison to recent games, and even the original Mass Effect trilogy.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">As a player of the </span>the first<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"> three games, however, I have to wonder whether the hordes of detractors have done the same. The facial animations in those three titles were average at best, and downright nightmare-inducing at worst, yet the games are still regarded as masterpieces of the medium. Are angry fans wearing their rose-tinted visors when it comes to the original trilogy, or were they simply expecting more of an improvement in the </span>five year<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"> gap since Mass Effect 3?</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">With all of the vitriol being fired in Bioware's direction, it's hard not to feel a twinge of pity for the </span>studio.<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"> However, their mistakes in this deep-space debacle should not be overlooked. Mass Effect: Andromeda was released three days prior to launch under EA's Origin Access scheme. Early players of the game pay a monthly premium to be involved in Origin Access and were granted a limited section of the single-player campaign to experience.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">This trial is restricted to 10 hours, with a hard cutoff point at a certain point in the story. From my experience, I've found that the first hours of Bioware RPG's are often the weakest; the section in which the tedious but crucial exposition and </span>foundationis<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"> laid out for the player. The fun comes from building upon that foundation by making new discoveries, impactful decisions, and connecting to the characters over many hours of gameplay. This is why giving players access to such a small part of Andromeda was a tragic mistake.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">With no long-term investment in the game, players are left to analyse the least enjoyable parts of any Bioware experience: the animations, the jerkiness, and the heavy expository dialogue. If the game was released in full, these criticisms wouldn't be any less valid, but they would, perhaps, be measured more fairly in an analysis of the whole experience.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">We've yet to see if the public backlash will impact the success of Andromeda, but social media is ablaze with countless dissatisfied gamers claiming to have cancelled their pre-orders. Regardless of the game's reception, it seems that almost everyone can learn a lesson during this rocky launch period. To disappointed gamers: manage your expectations. To Bioware: play to your strengths.</span></p>
