As another year in gaming is rapidly coming to an end, it is time to look back at the good and the bad that was gaming in 2017, as well as look forward to what 2018 has in store for gamers.<br><br><br><b>Biggest Surprise</b><p><br></p><p><br></p><p></p><p></p><p>In 2017 there can only be one thing that can be considered the biggest surprise, and that is <i>Player Unknown's Battlegrounds</i> (aka <i>PUBG</i>). Since its release, <i>PUBG</i> has been like a snowball rolling down a mountain in that it has built and built to the point where <i>PUBG</i> is now arguably the biggest game in the world right now. With over 10 Million downloads on Steam and a hostile takeover of Steam's most concurrent user record, <i>PUBG</i> is truly the breakout star of 2017, and since it's an indie game I don't see how this cannot be seen as the Biggest Surprise of 2017.<br><br><br><br><b>Biggest Disappointment</b></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p></p><p></p><p>In a year full of hits and misses, there has only been one game has failed more than any other (and remember this is a year where <a href="http://gamesharkreviews.com/review.php?t=Sonic_Forces_Review&amp;g=Sonic_Forces"><i>Sonic Forces</i></a> and <i>Troll and I</i> came out), and that game is <a href="http://gamesharkreviews.com/review.php?t=Star_Wars%3A_Battlefront_2_Review&amp;g=Star_Wars%3A_Battlefront_2"><i>Star Wars: Battlefront 2</i></a>. Not so much because of it's gameplay (which is a huge improvement on 2015's <i>Battlefront</i>) but mostly because of its weak storyline and EA's constant need to suck as much money out of its fan base as possible. <i>Star Wars: Battlefront 2</i> has had nothing but controversy and horrible defences of said controversies, and for that, it has firmly beat all of the bad games this year it wins a gloss painted, golden Biggest Disappointment Plaque (because nothing that bad deserves a trophy). <br><br><br><br><b>Most Anticipated for 2018</b></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p></p><p></p><p>I am just going to cut to the point, the game that I am most anticipating in 2018 is <i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i>. I picked <i>RDR 2</i> because I loved the first game because of the open world, funny characters, and rich narrative which mostly consisted of John Marston being dicked around by the population of New Austin. In a year of amazing releases like <i>The Last of Us 2</i>, <i>God of War</i>, <i>Monster Hunter World</i>, and <i>Far Cry 5</i>; <i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i> has only just edged out the competition, although the real winners in 2018 are gamers around the world for we are all in for a plentiful bounty and lack of suntan in 2018 <br><br><br><br><b>Game of The Year (2017)</b></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p></p><p></p><p>While there have been many great games in 2017, I feel that for this award I must give it to a game that I personally reviewed. With that being said, by the numbers and my pure enjoyment <i>Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus</i> is my Game of the Year. Everything from the beautiful graphics (which is weird to say when talking about a first-person shooter), stellar combat mechanics, and an emotional roller coaster of a narrative that will take you from the highest of Nazi killing highs to nuclear crater lows, <i>Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus</i> truly is Game of the Year that everybody should go and play.</p><p></p>
