After their most recent press conference at the end of March, Square Enix have released a brand new demo for Final Fantasy XV.<p><br><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none" align="LEFT">The Platinum Demo is a short story of a young Prince Noctis, innocently dreaming while trouble is unfolding around him. Throughout his dream, he is guided by Carbuncle, a guardian that promises to protect him. Each dream phase reveals new elements that will be in the final game including: combat, weather changes and magic. </p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none" align="LEFT"><br></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none" align="LEFT">As Noctis proceeds further into his drea<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">ms, he can step onto plates that will alter the environment around him. Both night and day sequences offer impressive lighting effects not seen in the previous demo. Other plates found, changed the weather and even turned Noctis into a vehicle or monster. There are also brief moments when future summons are revealed in the background. They are amazing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none" align="LEFT"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none" align="LEFT">The combat and weapon system has been overhauled since Episode Duscae. It may be simple at face value, but there is more complexity to the demo's combat system. Switching weapons is done on the fly, opening up a seemingly endless amount of combinations. Each weapon has a purpose and this allows for a variety of moves that can be adjusted for every type of battle. Evading and countering enemy attacks are important and can lead into special attacks performed by Noctis. </p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none" align="LEFT"><br></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none" align="LEFT">Unlike Episode Duscae, the Platinum Demo demonstrates the graphical capabilities of the full game, but, there are still some things that need fixing. The camera feels like it can't keep up during combat and sometimes becomes stuck in smaller spaces. The game also needs alternate control schemes for targeting and combat. As it stands, the button combinations feel awkward. By having the ability to switch them around would help the game play more naturally. </p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none" align="LEFT"><br></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none" align="LEFT">Inspired by Carbuncle, Noctis unlocks his full potential to defend himself at the e<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">nd of the demo. Warping around different points of the final area is awesome and can be used to escape or initiate combat in a stylish way. The combat is quick, meaning that no two fights will be the same.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none" align="LEFT"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none" align="LEFT">The Platinum Demo gives fans a brief glimpse into the progress of Final Fantasy XV. While some minor issues still exist, everything else seems to be shaping up into the game everyone has been waiting for.</p></p>
