In a recent co-ed published by the Times video-games have yet again been used as a scapegoat to explain sociological issues. First it was violence, then it was misogyny, and now it’s education. The article frames the falling education rates in the United Kingdom (UK) as a result of the upsurge of online video games and the draw that this has for young male gamers.&nbsp;<p><br></p><p>&nbsp;Referring to a report from the Higher Education Policy Institute, tertiary education enrolments show a 6% gap in the favour of females in the country. This gender gap is becoming increasingly evident in all OECD member countries. In addition to this the report outlines that boys were more likely to play multiplayer video games online by a factor of 10. From this the Times based their article on the illusory correlation between online video gaming and decreased education levels.&nbsp;<p><br></p><p>It appears that the authors had never heard the phrase ‘correlation does not imply causation.’ Building off this premise they go onto state that the cause of the male drop-off in higher education is due to the fact that boys “waste more time” and “work less hard.” This argument is the crux of the article; painting a broad brush of the effects of video games as a waste of time and not conducive to positive outcomes.&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">This presentation of video-games provides a perspective which conforms to the preconceived notions of those in generations that did not grow up with video-games. For many of these people video-games have been an easy target for blame in relation to a variety of issues. Instead of addressing broader issues such as the dichotomy between the way males and females are socialised, they have used the infantile argument trying to blame leisurely activities.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><br></p><p>The author may have well claimed that falling enrollment rates for males have been because they read or play outside too much. Additionally, the Times willingly overlooked the ever-increasing research in the support of video-games showing the wide range of positive effects on cognitive development in children. Evidence-based research has shown that playing video-games may help children develop logical, literary, executive, and particularly pertinent to this case of online video-games; social skills.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>In an article published in the 2014 Fall issue American Journal of Play, researchers detailed the impact of action-games on a person’s perception, attention, memory and decision making. These abilities are considered by psychologists as the foundation of intelligence. This comes in contradiction to the meme of the harmful effects of video-games. Building off this the socialising impacts of video-games is also quite evident. An example of this can firstly be seen with sense of accomplishment that video-games provide. This is exemplified in games such as World of Warcraft of which the gameplay is based on this principle – once the player completes task he is immediately rewarded for it.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;As well as this they teach the concept of responsibility and a sense of morality. This is evidence in the sense that the stories and experiences that video-games provide have taken over from traditional mediums such as oral stories and fairy-tales. When looking at the Times’ argument down it brokers down to the belief that boys spending times playing video-games leads to decreased education levels. However, the reality of this argument is the implication that videos games are a waste of times as they propose no benefits in regards to cognitive development and education.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>As I have just outlined one of the many evidence-based studies in the contrary to this it is clear to see the infantile nature of the argument presented in Times article. They have fallen into the trap of blaming video-games for the disparity between higher-education rates between males and females instead of considering the impact of aspects such as gender equality and the differing career pathways that both are drawn towards.</p></p>
