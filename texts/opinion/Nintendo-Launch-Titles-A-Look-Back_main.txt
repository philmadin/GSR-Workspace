<br>The Nintendo Switch conference has come and gone, revealing to the public key features the console has to offer, such as the price, release date and online capabilities. As important as those things are however, we're all here for the games. The Nintendo Switch promises an approach more tailored to the 'hardcore' gamer, boasting a substantial list of developers to hep flesh out the system's third party support. Nintendo confirmed a list of games to be released with the Switch, to a varying degree of excitement from the public. Nintendo has been renowned for its launch titles ever since the NES, so we decided to put the Switch to the test against the consoles that came before.<br><br><br><u><b>The Nintendo Entertainment System</b></u><br><br>Launch titles<i>: Super Mario Bros/Duck Hunt, 10 Yard Fight, Baseball, Clu Clu Land, Donkey Kong Jr. Math, Excitebike, Golf, Gyromite, Hogan's Alley, Ice Climber, Kung-Fu, Mach Rider, Pinball, Stack-Up, Tennis, Wild Gunman, Wrecking Crew.</i><br><br>Nintendo came right out of the gate with some big hitters, with <i>Super</i> <i>Mario</i> <i>Bros.</i> being arguably the most influential video games in history. Everything else falls in with the more casual market, serving as an intermission between adventuring with the Italian plumber.<br><br><br><u><b>The Super Nintendo Entertainment System</b></u><br><br>Launch titles:<i> F-Zero, Gradius III, Pilotwings, SimCity, Super Mario World<br></i><br>A much more streamlined list here, and all the better for it. <i>Mario</i> dominates again, but the other titles all go onto become successful franchises in their own right.<br><br><br><u><b>Nintendo 64</b></u><br><br>Launch titles<i>: Pilot Wings 64, Super Mario 64</i><br><br>Nintendo once again proved to be the king of innovation, just as they did back in 1985. <i>Super</i> <i>Mario</i> <i>64</i> showed us the world of 3D, and gaming has never been the same.<br><br><br><u><b>Gamecube</b></u><br><br>Launch titles:<i> All-Star Baseball 2002, Batman: Vengeance, Crazy Taxi, Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2, Disney's Tarzan Untamed, Luigi's Mansion, Madden NFL 2002, NHL Hitz 20-02, Star Wars Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader, Super Monkey Ball, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3, Wave Race: Blue Storm.</i><br><br>Nintendo's first console of the new millennium brought us a mixed bag if ever there was one. <i>Luigi's</i> <i>Mansion</i>, <i>Rogue</i> <i>Squadron</i> <i>II</i> and <i>Pro</i> <i>Skater</i> <i>3</i> are fantastic games, but the list is also littered with less-than-stellar entries like <i>Batman:</i> <i>Vengeance</i> and <i>Tarzan</i> <i>Untamed</i>. It could be said the Gamecube's launch set the precedent for the console as a whole; great potential squandered by the mediocrity around it.<br><br><br><u><b>Wii</b></u><br><br>Launch titles:<i> Avatar: The Last Airbender, Call of Duty 3, Cars, Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 2, Excite Truck, The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy, GT Pro Series, Happy Feet, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, Madden NFL 07, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, Monster 4x4: World Circuit, Need for Speed: Carbon, Rampage: Total Destruction, Rayman Raving Rabbids, Red Steel, SpongeBob SquarePants: Creature from the Krusty Krab, Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz, Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam, Trauma Center: Second Opinion, Wii Sports.</i><br><br>A prime example of quantity over quality, <i>Twilight</i> <i>Princess</i> is a standout but still is nowhere near the peak of the <i>Zelda</i> franchise. <i>Wii</i> <i>Sports</i> went on to become one of the highest selling games of all time, evidence of Nintendo's ability to resonate with audiences. Unfortunately, the rest of the list spans from underdeveloped licensed games to underwhelming ports done better on other systems.<br><br><br><u><b>Wii U</b></u><br><br>Launch titles:<i> Assassin's Creed III, Batman: Arkham City - Armoured Edition, Ben 10: Omniverse, Call of Duty: Black Ops II, Chasing Aurora, Darksiders II, Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two, ESPN Sports Connection, FIFA Soccer 13, Funky Barn, Game Party Champions, Just Dance 4, Little Inferno, Madden NFL 13, Mass Effect 3: Special Edition, Mighty Switch Force! Hyper Drive Edition, Nano Assault Neo, NBA 2K13, New Super Mario Bros. U, Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge, Nintendo Land, Rabbids Land, Scribblenauts Unlimited, Sing Party, Skylanders Giants, Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed, Tank! Tank! Tank!, Tekken Tag Tournament 2: Wii U Edition, Transformers: Prime - The Game, Trine 2: Director's Cut, Warriors Orochi 3 Hyper, Wipeout 3, Your Shape: Fitness Evolved 2013, ZombiU</i><br><br>It all led to this. The Gamecube and Wii's launches were not impressive by any stretch of the imagination, but at least it showed some shred of potential. When it comes to the Wii U, you can clearly see how the system grossly underperformed in the market. Here we see more underwhelming ports to games that came too little too late. <i>New Super</i> <i>Mario</i> <i>Bros.</i> <i>U</i>, <i>Scribblenauts</i> <i>Unlimited</i> and <i>Darksiders</i> <i>II</i> are decent, good even, but the rest amount to less than a stocking stuffer.<br><br><br><u><b>Nintendo Switch</b></u><br><br>Launch titles:<i> The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, 1-2-Switch, Just Dance 2017, Skylanders Imaginators, Super Bomberman R</i><br><br>Keep in mind that other games are still to be announced for launch on March 3rd, but don't expect Wii U numbers either. Less launch titles would be a good move here, instead of saturating the market with underwhelming content. That being said, <i>Breath</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>Wild</i> is the only game on this list that warrants a purchase for me personally. <i>Just</i> <i>Dance</i> and <i>Skylanders</i> have its fans, but most gamers will have to wait out for <i>Mario</i> <i>Kart</i> <i>8</i> in April and <i>Splatoon</i> midway through the year.<br><br>Overall, I'm hopeful that the Switch will end up proving to be a great console, with a vast library of quality games for gamers of all kinds. But as I see it, launch titles are a symbol of trust, as well as a teaser of things to come. The NES, SNES and N64 were so successful in part to having stellar launch titles, flooring the public right from the get go. This also works both ways, evident in the Wii U becoming one of the most unsuccessful consoles of all time. Will the Switch break that trend? We'll just have to wait and see.<br><br><br><b>This article is the opinion of the author, and does not reflect the thoughts of GSR.<br><p></p></b>
