Gold Coast Supanova 2017 was held on the weekend of April 21-23, attracting over 3,000 comic, anime, television, film and gaming fans from across the country.<br><br>The event started on <b>Friday</b> the 21st at 6 pm with the weekend preview, where all of the guests were invited to talk about what they were doing over the weekend. Some of the more Australian questions included "What is a cassowary? Is it an Emu going through its emo phase? Or is it one of the most aggressive and dangerous birds in the world?".<br><br>After the preview there was a Q&amp;A&nbsp; with Vic Mignogna, where he answered questions from fans. Very animated, Vic spent more time off the stage interacting with the audience than he did on stage.<br><br>On <b>Saturday</b> the 22nd of April, Supanova opened at 10:30 am. I spent most of this day walking around the convention hall in awe of the amazing work that had gone into all of the cosplays I saw. From Harley Quinn to the <i>Fallout</i> survivors, so much time and effort had been put in that they all looked like they had jumped out of the screen to attend Supanova.<br><br>For many of the attendees, the main attraction kicked off at 1:30 with <b>David Boreanaz</b> taking to the stage for a Q&amp;A session. The star of <i>Buffy</i>, <i>Angel</i>, and <i>Bones</i> spoke about this being his first time in Australia, as well as engaging in a bit of banter with the fans. He answered questions about his acting roles while eating Tim Tams that were given to him by a lady in the front row. At the end of his Q&amp;A, he spoke of how he wanted to do a project based on the mafia, and then thanked the man that made his attendance possible, praising the work he does in bringing the stars to these events so that the fans can meet them.<br><br>On <b>Sunday,</b> the final day of the Gold Coast Supanova 2017, the Supanova Superhero Parade made its way from Kurrawa park to Surf Parade in Broadbeach. On this final day I attended Nolan North's Q&amp;A, where he spoke about how he started voice acting to support his family because stage and screen jobs were few and far between, and how he used an Australian accent to get a beer at a bar while he was underage in America. He also spoke on how he develops his various voices from daily interactions with people. Nova mentioned his dream of visiting New Zealand, and riding a tank with Peter Jackson to a local pub.<br><br>After the Q&amp;A was over I went back into the convention hall where I interacted with many cosplayers taking pictures with and of them for my Twitter account (<a href="https://twitter.com/bitwbatnick">@BITWBATNICK</a>).<br><br>After spending time with the cosplayers, I went and tried my hand at using the HTC Vive on a Bar Fight Simulator. This game is a lot of fun! Following my adventures in VR I waited for my eyes to adjust to AR (actual reality), then went over to attend the live Twitch stream which Supanova broadcasted on their Twitch channel; and lastly watched some workshops ranging from how to create and maintain a successful stream, to how to turn your photography hobby into a career.<br><br>After some time spent in the convention hall, I went and attended one of the seminars and decided to sit in on the Comics and mental health seminar. The seminar discussed how comics and art can help people through some tough times in their lives, with the following Q&amp;A answering some audience questions on how to cope when life gets hard, as well as tips on improving mental health.<br><br>The events that ended the Gold Coast Supanova were the Cosplay contest and the Kamehameha contests. These showcased the talent, determination and creative passion of the fans (as well as their lung capacity). During this contest, I saw some amazing cosplays that had so much detail and passion put into them (as well as a lot of red faces and broken voices from using all their energy making the most powerful Kamehameha) and I believe that all of the participants deserved a prize.<br><br>I thoroughly enjoyed my time at the Gold Coast Supanova even though my legs did hurt for a few days afterwards. Thank you to the organisers and staff of Supanova for the opportunity to attend, and for looking after everyone there. I had fun interacting with my fellow gamers and pop culture fans and look forward to seeing them at the next event in November.<br>
