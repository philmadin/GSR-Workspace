<p><br></p><p><br></p>It's hard to imagine a world where smart phones don't exist. I imagine it would be like that <i>Futurama</i> episode where Bender abandons society and carves himself out of wood. Except in reality we'd probably all just be out there in the real world doing that uncomfortable thing known as 'socialising'.&nbsp;<p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Yeah don't worry, I prefer playing video games as well. So much so that I compiled a list of the top MMOs that are currently available on android.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color:rgb(255,0,0);"><b style="color:rgb(255,0,0);">1. Celtic Heroes</b></span></p><p><span style="color:rgb(255,0,0);"><br></span></p><p><br></p><p>First on our list we have a real time fantasy MMORPG known on the Google Play store as "<i>3D MMO Celtic Heroes</i>". This title is a free to play action adventure that boasts unique character customisation, varied quest lines, PVP combat and clan warfare. The controls are simple, character designs are surprisingly detailed and Celtic Heroes also includes some rather interesting quests for a mobile game. In my experience, this game was very easy to pick up and a great starting option for those looking to try out mobile MMO's.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onethumbmobile.celticheroes&amp;hl=en">Download the popular mobile game here!</a></p><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onethumbmobile.celticheroes&amp;hl=en"><br></a></p><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onethumbmobile.celticheroes&amp;hl=en"><br></a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color:rgb(255,0,0);"><b style="color:rgb(255,0,0);">2. Arcane Legends</b></span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>With over ten million downloads next to its name, <i>Arcane Legends</i> has long been near the top of the mobile MMO landscape. This title brings all the features one would come to expect from a handheld MMO experience. These include dungeon crawling, looting, boss battles and guild selection. Fans of fantasy adventure will also be pleased to do battle against a who's who list of enemies such as orcs, mages and dragons. Some say that the game has fallen on hard times with recent lackluster updates and unfriendly customer service. However, after several years of being regarded as one of the best mobile games available, who's to say that <i>Arcane Legends</i> can't return to its former glory?</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sts.al&amp;hl=en">Arcane Legends is available here</a></p><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sts.al&amp;hl=en"><br></a></p><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sts.al&amp;hl=en"><br></a></p><p><span style="color:rgb(255,0,0);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color:rgb(255,0,0);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color:rgb(255,0,0);"><b style="color:rgb(255,0,0);">3. Clash of Clans</b></span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Ah yes, <i>Clash of Clans</i>. Through all of my darkest moments, alongside all of my greatest trials and tribulations there has always been at least one constant to keep me company along the way. That of course is the <i>Clash of Clans</i> advertisement. One of the most memorable mobile marketing campaigns of our time has also resulted in one of the best MMO experiences. This game lets you create and protect villages, raise hordes and take the fight to other players around the globe. If you have ever been interested in trying out the mobile MMO landscape , then this is probably the best place to start.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.supercell.clashofclans&amp;hl=en">Build your clan starting now!</a></p><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.supercell.clashofclans&amp;hl=en"><br></a></p><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.supercell.clashofclans&amp;hl=en"><br></a></p><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.supercell.clashofclans&amp;hl=en"><br></a></p><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.supercell.clashofclans&amp;hl=en"><br></a></p><p></p><span style="color:rgb(255,0,0);"><p style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><b style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">4. Mobile Strike</b></p><p style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></p></span><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Speaking of big advertising campaigns, it doesn't get much bigger (both physically and financially) than Arnie himself. <i>Mobile Strike</i> is a fast growing MMO that has similarities to <i>Clash of Clans</i>, except instead of building villages, you are building full on military bases. Alliances can be forged, arsenals can be grown and as the title suggests, mobile strikes will land with conviction. A fun and addicting game that will make you feel like that 80's action hero you always wanted to be!</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.epicwaronline.ms&amp;hl=en">Strike now and strike here</a></p><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.epicwaronline.ms&amp;hl=en"><br></a></p><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.epicwaronline.ms&amp;hl=en"><br></a></p><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.epicwaronline.ms&amp;hl=en"><br></a></p><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.epicwaronline.ms&amp;hl=en"><br></a></p><p></p><span style="color:rgb(255,0,0);"><p style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><b style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">5. Boom Beach</b></p><p style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></p></span><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Here comes the boom! It's an odd little game but man is it entertaining. If you haven't noticed yet, there seems to be a definite correlation between base building and immense popularity when it comes to Android MMOs. That's not a bad thing however, as <i>Boom Beach</i> can stand and trade with the best of the genre. This game is free to play and thankfully not pay to win like other prominent mobile games out there. You know the formula by now, build bases, beat baddies, so on and so forth. What makes this title even more enjoyable is its cooperative play where you take on evil Blackguard Bosses with a friend.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.supercell.boombeach&amp;hl=en">Boom Beach available for download here</a></p><p></p>
