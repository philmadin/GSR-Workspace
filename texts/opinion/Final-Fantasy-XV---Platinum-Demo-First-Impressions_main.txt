After their most recent press conference at the end of March, SquareEnix have released a brand new demo for Final Fantasy XV.<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none" align="LEFT">The Platinum Demo is a short story about Prince Noctis dreaming as akid. He is joined by a guardian called Carbuncle, who leads himthrough various environments. The demo allows players to testelements that will be in the final game including: combat, weatherchanges and magic.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none" align="LEFT">The Platinum Demo is more of a tech demo than anything else. It ismissing some gameplay that was in the previous demo, Episode Duscae.This demo, while not fully optimised, is meant to demonstrate thegraphical capabilities of the full game.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none" align="LEFT">As Noctis proceeds further into his dreams, he can step onto platesthat will alter the environment around him. Both night and daysequences offer impressive lighting effects. The outdoor plaza areais especially dazzling with the Italian inspired architecture and magical waterfalls. The weather effects are another graphical testand may impact future gameplay as well. Other plates present in thegame, transform Noctis into a vehicle or monster. While it served noin game purpose, it was a small taste of what awaits fans.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none" align="LEFT">The combat and weapon system has been overhauled since EpisodeDuscae. Noctis can collect new weapons in his dream and are easilyassigned to the D-pad. Switching is done on the fly, while openingthe menu can replace a slot with a different weapon or magic source.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none" align="LEFT">It may be simple at face value, but there is more complexity to thedemo's combat system. A player can mash or hold the attack button toperform basic moves. This will only get a player so far. Divingdeeper, each weapon has a purpose and it's own set of moves dependingon the direction held. This allows for a variety of offensive anddefensive moves. Evading and countering enemy attacks are just asimportant and can lead into special attacks performed by Noctis. Itis amazing the amount of combo's that can be pulled from a limitedarsenal.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none" align="LEFT">Magic in Final Fantasy XV is a limited resource and is treated as aconsumable. Throwing it at an enemy will have a certain effect andcan become stronger if combined with the environment. It is fun andthe game is making sure that it isn't the go-to thing for a fight.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none" align="LEFT">The camera sill needs fixing as it felt like it couldn't keep up withthe action and was a little wonky in smaller spaces. Control mappingalso needs to be reconsidered. Some button placements worked, butmagic, throwing and targeting should have alternate control schemesso it feels more natural to play. </p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none" align="LEFT">The best part of the demo is at the end when you turn into adultNoctis, unlocking his full potential. Warping around different pointsof the final area is awesome and can be used to escape or initiatecombat in a stylish way. The combat can be quick, where a splitsecond can determine the difference between a perfect guard orreceiving a lot of damage.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none" align="LEFT">The Platinum Demo allows for plenty of exploration and collection.There are over 300 rubies to collect, four weapons and upgrades aswell. It gives fans a brief glimpse into the progress of FinalFantasy XV and it seems to be shaping up nicely.</p>
