Are you growing bored of your Dawn of War experience? Do want bigger armies, more units and loads of carnage? Well, I have the solution. For Soulstorm, we have Ultimate Apocalypse, for Retribution, Vengeance of the Blood Ravens.<p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Ultimate Apocalypse</b></p><p><br></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Ultimate Apocalypse is one of the more well-known Dawn of War mods. It does more than just increase unit caps and add a few new soldiers. It brings more than three new races, dozens of new units, solid balance and enormous attack troops such as the Imperial Titan and the mighty Baneblade tank. Tyranids, Daemons and the Inquisition are all playable and are very well done. While the voice acting is a little hit and miss for the new stuff, Ultimate Apocalypse is arguably the best way to play the original series of games. It's massive, on a scale comparable to games like Supreme Commander and far above what the base game could handle. To say it's impressive would be an incredible understatement.</p><p><br></p><p></p><p><a href="http://www.moddb.com/mods/ultimate-apocalypse-mod">Download&nbsp;</a></p><p></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Vengeance of the Blood Ravens</b></span></p><p><br></p><p><font color="#333333">Vengeance of the Blood Ravens doesn't make as many changes as Ultimate Apocalypse but what it does do is bring Dawn of War 1 style battles to what was once a smaller scale game. It's </font>definitely<font color="#333333">&nbsp;better balanced than Ultimate Apocalypse and it too brings a new race, the Tau. They're enjoyable enough but nothing special. Where it shines is in the massive battles that play out across the maps, countless units slaughtering each other as great heroes cut a path through smaller, weaker, enemies. Population limits have been adjusted and each commander brings more than just abilities to the field, instead of bringing specialised forces and devastating super units. While it's not often spoken of, Vengeance of the Blood Ravens takes what was a somewhat divisive game and turns it into one of the most enjoyable strategy games around.</font></p><p><font color="#333333"><br></font></p><p><a href="http://www.moddb.com/mods/vengeance-of-the-blood-ravens">Download</a></p>
