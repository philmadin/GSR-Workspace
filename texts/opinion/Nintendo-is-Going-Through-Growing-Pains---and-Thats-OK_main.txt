When it comes to Nintendo, it seems like there's never a dull moment.<br><br>During the company's most recent financial briefing, several bombshells were announced. Amid the lackluster hardware sales and strong software performance, president Tatsumi Kimishima confirmed that the NX would launch in March 2017, along with a next-gen version of the long awaited <i>Legend of Zelda</i>.<br><br>Much gnashing of teeth ensued, as this would be the second time Link's adventure would suffer a significant delay. To add salt to the wound, the Kyoto-based firm revealed that not only would the NX <i>not</i> be at E3, but that Zelda itself would be the <i>only playable game</i> on the show floor.<br><br>Citing "immersion" (whatever that means) as the reason for such a bizarre decision, Nintendo's latest move has predictably resulted in the red-hot ire of the internet.<br><br>Yet again, pundits have declared that the 127 year old corporation is on its last legs.<br><br>Of course, such hyperbolic claims are nothing new, but one has to wonder just what the future holds for the House of Mario. With recent upheavals in development departments, executive shake-ups, and the shift to mobile, it's clear that change is in the air.<br><br>This is a good thing.<br><br>Yes, I'm going to have to play devil's advocate here, and point out to GSR's dear readers just exactly why Nintendo is <i>evolving</i> - rather than regressing.<br><br>First, E3. The decision to make Zelda the only videogame that attendees will be able to play was certainly an unprecedented move. Additionally, the lack of an NX info blowout will certainly feel like a gut-punch (especially after last year's disappointing show). However, Nintendo's deemphasis on the LA games extravaganza isn't entirely without precedent. <br><br>Staring with the introduction of its Digital Event in 2013, it's increasingly clear that the company simply doesn't see the show as being important as it once was. With the rise of the internet and social media, Nintendo has placed greater focus on its regular Nintendo Direct presentations as a cheaper and more effective way of marketing its products. Similarly, other industry trade shows like PAX, Gamescom and Paris Games Show have stolen a chunk of the E3 pie (with Gamescom in particular actually surpassing the LA event's attendance numbers), and now we're seeing publishers outright ditching it altogether, with Disney and EA both confirming their absence this year. Another strong indication of E3's increasing irrelevance is with Sony, which created the Playstation Experience show a couple of years ago. All of this, combined with the high cost of actually renting space and setting up conferences, affirms that Nintendo actually does know what it's doing.<br><br>All of this is emblematic of a wider change within Nintendo - and indeed, the industry itself. In actual fact, all of the 'big three' companies are undergoing restructures. With Sony, this was especially evident a few years ago, when the firm was hemorrhaging money, and was forced to sell entire divisions and assets in order to curb crippling debt. Though it's still going through some company-wide woes (security embarrassments don't help), the Playstation brand is as strong as ever, and this has been helped by Sony's movement into new territories like virtual reality and cloud technology.<br><br>Microsoft too, has endured a few storms. Though out-pacing the Xbox 360, the Xbox One has struggled in the shadow of the PS4; to the point where Microsoft are no longer reporting sales; preferring instead to tout the brand's usage statistics. Though forced to abolish the Xbox Entertainment division, MS have nevertheless been moving into blending all of its services into the Windows ecosystem - including Xbox. On top of intriguing moves into VR and augmented reality, it's clear that the Redmond firm is determined to regain its innovative edge in a marketplace that has previously passed them by.<br><br>This all leads to Nintendo. As illustrated by its main competition, change affects all, and it doesn't necessarily mean doom. Yes, the Wii U was a sales disappointment. But so was the Playstation Vita. So was the Windows Phone (even though I own both - yay me). Flops happen. Sales dip. It's not unprecedented. Heck, even the almighty smart phone market has seen a downward turn recently. However, as history has shown, Nintendo is remarkably resilient in the face of change, and all indications point to a wise restructuring. Both home console and handheld divisions have been merged for greater autonomy (furthering the rumours of NX being a hybrid of the two), and Shigeru Miyamoto himself has founded the 'Project Garage' movement, which consists of new ideas from young designers within the company (<i>Splatoon</i> being the first product of this initiative). We're also now seeing the fledgling My Nintendo reward system as a way to incentivise users in engaging with Nintendo products, as well as plans to build theme parks, and produce mobile games (with <i>Miitomo</i> already achieving 10 million users). Even the very way the company is being run has seen huge changes; obviously, we have a new president in Tatsumi Kimishima, but we've also just learned that both Reggie Fils-Aime and Satoru Shibata have been given 'Executive Officer' titles, as part of Nintendo's new 'Audit/Supervisory Committee and Officer System', which aims to help the company operate in a manner similar to its Western brethren.<br><br>So, a lot's happening then... but what does all of this mean for us, the average gamers?<br><br>Unfortunately, there's not much Nintendo fans can do at this point but just grin and bear it for the time being. Though the Wii U and 3DS have been suffering some software droughts (particularly the former), there is still plenty to look forward to. No, really!<br><br>The 3DS will soon be getting <i>Kirby: Planet Robobot</i>, <i>Dragon Quest VII</i> and <i>VIII</i>, <i>Metroid Prime: Federation Force</i>, <i>Rhythm Heaven Megamix</i>, <i>Monster Hunter Generations</i>, <i>Zero Time Dilemma</i>, <i>Sonic Boom: Fire & Ice</i>, <i>Bravely Second: End Layer</i>, A<i>zure Striker Gunvolt 2</i> and <i>Pokemon Sun/Moon</i>.<br><br>Though on its last legs, the Wii U too, is still getting <i>Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE</i>, <i>Paper Mario: Colour Splash</i>, <i>Mighty No.9</i>, <i>Bloostained: Ritual of the Night</i>, <i>Yooka-Laylee</i> and (of course) the <i>Legend of Zelda</i>. I haven't even mentioned the steady flow of indie and classic games that continue to bolster both machines...<br><br>With the confirmation of <i>Fire Emblem</i> and <i>Animal Crossing</i> for mobiles, and (hopefully) some new game announcements at E3, and it seems to me that Nintendo still has a nice selection for the rest of 2016, before the big NX reveal ushers in the next generation.<br><br>Â <br><br>
