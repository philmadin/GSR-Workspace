<p><b>Biggest Surprise</b></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The Nintendo Switch was advertised as a portable console, but its versatility revealed itself to me at this year's EB Expo. With the many uses for the "Joy-Cons", and the number of accessories and options to customise the way you use the Switch, it is turning out to be a far bigger platform than anyone expected, and thus, my biggest surprise of 2017.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The most visibly varied use of the hardware available is <i>Super Mario Odyssey</i>. As the game was made to essentially sell the Switch, it's got just as many gimmicks as other launch day games such as <i>Infamous Second Son</i>. But this works really well for Mario, and it's much more fun shaking two tiny controllers for a gimmick than it is shaking a normal-sized (and highly expensive) PS4 controller.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Biggest Disappointment</b></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Full disclosure: I didn't actually play much of <i style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Agents Of Mayhem</i>. I knew that it wasn't a Saints Row game, and I saw enough gameplay in the trailers to lower my expectations, a lot. But somehow it still managed to limbo under the incredibly low bar I set it.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><i style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Agents Of Mayhem</i> is a nothing game. Its city is lifeless and empty, and the tired drab neon colours of Seoul do little to disguise this fact. In fact, the open world is a complete waste of time, which is not something you want to hear from a reviewer who adores the Saints Row franchise as much as I do, and still plays Lego games just for the open worlds.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><br></p><p><b><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Most Anticipated for 2018</span></b></p><p><b><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></b></p><p><b><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></b></p><p></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">2018 is shaping up to be a huge year in video games, or at least, as far as my interests are concerned.

With <i style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Sunset Overdrive</i>, they've proved they can make traversal interesting, which is essential for a <i style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Spider-Man</i> game. And the onslaught of YouTube videos, analysing every facet of every gameplay clip, all seem to agree that this title could just be the superhero-themed game of the year for 2018.</span><br></p><p><br></p><p></p><p></p><p><b><b><b><b><b><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Game Of The Year 2017</span></b></b></b></b></b></p><p><b><b><b><b><b><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></b></b></b></b></b></p><p><b><b><b><b><b><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></b></b></b></b></b></p><p></p><p>It kind of pains me to name <i>Assassin's Creed Origins</i> as my Game Of The Year, considering all the other smash hits we've had this year.
