<p>In <a href="http://gamesharkreviews.com/opinion.php?t=GETSTATUS%3A_Gaming_in_China_pt.1">part 1</a> of this series we looked at how the gaming scene in China has been shaped to what it is today, with <a href="http://gamesharkreviews.com/opinion.php?t=GETSTATUS%3A_Gaming_in_China_pt.2">part 2 </a>giving some insight as to how to game as a foreigner. In the 3rd and final part to this series we will combine the two, and look at China's position in the global gaming market.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>If you ask me to name any Chinese games or influences on pop culture, I can't, and I bet many of you couldn't either. Chinese games and pop culture are heavily engrained in their traditional roots and ways. It's a very specific market, and sees many influences from the romanticised 'Three Kingdoms' period around 220-280CE. Celebrated and popularised in operas, novels, films and games, think of it as their bread and butter. And eggs, cereal, waffles, bacon, pancakes... you get the idea. They quite often contain stories of love amongst friends, races and countries as well as traditional Chinese culture - of course regulated to maintain the sovereignty and ideals of the nation.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>This manifests itself as a barrier to foreigners as both originality and variety are lacking, which consequently fails to satisfy what many of us crave as geeks/nerds. To many it's the freedom to create and express ourselves how we want, and the younger Chinese generation are no different. They are getting their hit from South Korea: a country that balances their own values and beliefs with capitalist and Western cultures. These similarities combined with a strong, independent media comparatively free from regulation is a source of inspiration for new ideas and ways of thinking, but is also creating a clash of generations - young people not wanting to carry to baggage of the Chinese dream, and of course the older generation believing this is corruption.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The Chinese government is recognising that this is a missed opportunity, especially given the success that their Asian neighbours have had. Military might is one thing but a strong cultural presence can be just as, if not more powerful. With all the negative stigma associated with gaming it was very interesting when they officially recognised e-sports as an official sport in 2003, albeit with one caveat - there is a clear distinction that 'E-sports is a sport, and must be strictly separated from internet games' (Champion League Tournament, 2010). In 2013, the World Cyber Games in Kunshan brought in a reported 155,000 live spectators and 150 million online viewers. The government is now using this popularity of e-sports to draw tourism and positive press to China and attempting to rebrand themselves as more than just a manufacturing country - that they can do entertainment as well. The irony here however is that the broadcast of such events is strictly banned on public TV.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Some companies however are taking things into their own hands. With such heavy external influences, they are aiming to rectify the cultural imbalance themselves by forming partnerships and alliances with foreign companies. To many the Chinese market poses many difficulties in regards to localisation, monetisation (due to piracy) and heavy regulation. By working with a local partner these companies are able to break down these barriers, and this is happening as we speak. Not even last week Psyonix announced a partnership with TenCent to release <i>Rocket League</i> in China. This is a two-way street mind you, many Chinese companies face similar difficulties when expanding to foreign markets and these partnerships are allowing content to flow in both directions.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>It can be argued that it is too little too late, as the rest of the world has been riding pop-culture waves from the likes of Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong. As the Chinese are trying to expand they're simply overshadowed by the amount of Eastern content already out there. But give it time - with a population this big it is inevitable we will begin to see more Chinese influences in the crazes we follow and content we consume.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>For better or for worse.</p>
