<b>Biggest Surprise</b><br><br><p>Hitman. I've never been a massive fan of the <i>Hitman </i>franchise and as such, wasn't expecting a whole lot from 2016's offering. But as it turned out it was one of the more enjoyable games of the year. The massive levels, tight controls and even the episodic nature of the content added up to be an excellent stealth shooter that I never saw coming.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Biggest Disappointment</b></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Battlefield 1. Don't get me wrong, <i>Battlefield 1</i> is a good game, a really good game but it fails in one major aspect. The WW1 setting has very little impact on the battlefield formula. Everyone runs around with automatic weapons and sniper rifles and I just can't figure out why they chose The Great War for a game that's so familiar. Go back to WW2, a setting that suits the <i>Battlefield </i>formula, if you want the submachine guns, lmg's and anti-tank rifles that plague <i>Battlefield 1</i>. If you want to try a game that does well by WW1, check out Verdun instead.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Most Anticipated for 2017</b></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">I can't decide which game I want more, <i style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Dawn of War 3</i> or <i style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Mount and Blade: Bannerlord</i>.

It carries with a lineage almost as old as the genre itself. It lifts a heavy burden, the expectations of thousands of fans. And it most certainly meets them, hell, even surpasses them. Fast combat, fluid movement and brutal kills, <i>Doom</i> is, hands down, the best game of 2016 and arguably one of the best shooters, ever. Rip and tear your way to hell and back, it's worth it.</p>
