At roughly 2 am (Australian time) on the 31st of October, I managed to get myself out of bed to watch <i>PlayStation's Showcase at Paris Games Week 2017</i> where they decided to show the world (almost) everything they had in store for gamers in 2018. From new VR titles to the continuations of some fan favourites, PlayStation had a lot to show off.&nbsp;<p><br><br>So let's delve into what gamers were shown at<i> Paris Games Week 2017's PlayStation Showcase</i>.<br><br>PlayStation VR once again was at the forefront of a PlayStation Showcase, with a plethora of new titles both announced and expanded upon. While VR is still really in its infancy when it comes to AAA gaming, PlayStation is making a tremendous step towards trying to steal the VR market away from Steam. <br><br>With many titles coming to the system in 2018, I can personally say that the only games that seem of interest to me were <i>Stifled, </i>a horror game that completely relies on the sound you can create to manifest a visualization of the world around you (which is out now on the PlayStation Store), and <i>Blood and Truth</i>, a game which I can only describe as Transporter meets James Bond action adventure through an English hotel, which sees you become the action hero.&nbsp; <br><br>Other than that there were about seven other PlayStation VR games that were announced or had more footage shown and they were:</p><p><br><br><i>Bow to Blood<br></i></p><p><i>Megalith<br></i></p><p><i>Ultrawings<br></i></p><p><i>Star Child<br></i></p><p><i>Resident Evil 7: Not a Hero (free DLC)<br></i></p><p><i>Zombie Burgers<br></i></p><p><i>League of War<br></i></p><p><i>Final Fantasy XV: Monster of the Deep</i><br><br>Where I believe that the showcase became truly interesting was when PlayStation decided to show off some of their non-VR titles. As with every year, they hyped new content for current games, such as the new <i>Destiny 2 DLC Curse of Osiris</i> and<i> Final Fantasy XV: Episode Ignis.</i>&nbsp;</p><p><br><br>They gave gamers a look at Sucker Punch Studios intriguing Samurai game <i>Ghost of Tsushima</i>, Pixel Opus' new game <i>Concrete Genie</i>, Activision's' juggernaut <i>Call of Duty: WW2</i>, Ubisoft's' wildly fun<i> Far Cry 5</i>, Insomniacs' much anticipated <i>Spiderman</i> game, Santa Monica Studios' <i>God of War</i> reboot of sorts, the emotionally gripping <i>Detroit: Become Human</i>, Japan Studios graphically beautiful <i>Shadow of the Colossus</i> remake, and for the first time in almost a year gamers got more details on <i>The Last of Us Part 2</i> from a short trailer that looked so real, I thought it was a live-action trailer.</p><p><br><br>Other games announced or expanded on were:</p><p><br><br><i>Guacamelee 2</i></p><p><i><br>Spelunky 2</i></p><p><i><br>Oure (available now on PlayStation Store)<br></i></p><p><i>Invector</i></p><p><i>Tennis World tour</i></p><p><i>The Sims 4<br></i></p><p><i>The Gardens Between<br></i></p><p><i>LocoRoco 2<br></i></p><p><i>The Hong Kong Massacre<br></i></p><p><i>Play Link game Erica</i></p><p><i>On Rush<br></i></p><p><i>Horizon Zero Dawn: The Frozen Wilds (DLC)<br></i></p><p><i>Monster Hunter:World</i> (now with Aloy from <i>Horizon Zero Dawn</i> as DLC)<br><br>All up I thought the<i> PlayStation Showcase at Paris Games Week</i> was a parade of dull VR titles, followed by some interesting 2018 titles.<br></p>
