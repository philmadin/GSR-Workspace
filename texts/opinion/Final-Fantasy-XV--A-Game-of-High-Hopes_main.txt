After an extremely long wait, the much anticipated Final Fantasy XV is due to arrive this March.<br />
<br />
<br />
<h3>Up On A Pedestal</h3>The development began in 2006, when it was first promoted as Final Fantasy Versus XIII. Slow production, staff changes and other project issues have hampered its release. Square Enix's signature approach in regards to new information, has always drawn frustration from both journalists and fans alike. <br />
<br />
While most fans wish to discover the storyline themselves, no one likes to piece scraps of information together either. This leads to unrealistic expectations of the game as everyone has formed an image of the ideal game in their minds. The bar could possibly be set too high.<br />
<br />
<h3>How To Keep Everyone Happy</h3>Square Enix may have learnt an expensive lesson from Final Fantasy XV. The long development cycle of the game has been a drain on their time, with other titles such as Kingdom Hearts 3 and Final Fantasy 7 Remake suffering as the result. Square Enix needs to focus on what is important and that is their fans. <br />
<br />
Information is severely lacking for a game due sometime this year. A vague story summary, a handful of images and trailers is not enough to make a judgement call on the game. Hopefully, after March we may see more trailers and possibly a demo to calm fears; as this has been the longest wait between a mainline Final Fantasy that wasn't a sequel or side game. <br />
<br />
The game has to deliver in terms of story, graphics and gameplay. All of these aspects have undergone many changes over the course of ten years. The transition from director, Tetsuya Nomura to Hajime Tabata, has allowed development to advance quickly, while keeping close to the original vision of the game. The success of Final Fantasy XV will more than likely determine the chances of a new numbered Final Fantasy game in the future.<br />
<br />
<h3>On Track To Success</h3>Despite the uncertainty, Square Enix have listened to feedback after the demo Episode Duscae. Concerns over the UI, party commands and controls were slightly alleviated with the release of the most recent trailer called Niflheim Base Battle. Combat seems faster and more responsive, showing the different ways to combo with the party. <br />
<br />
Unique scenarios where the player can choose a stealth approach, use weapons or the environment to their advantage are some of the ways of drawing players interest.  The soundtrack sounds epic and fitting for the theme of the game. <br />
<br />
Graphics have improved greatly since the last set of images, with more details and effects. Square Enix has an amazing batch of games due out in the next few years and fingers are painfully crossed that Final Fantasy XV can lead the way into a great future for the company.
