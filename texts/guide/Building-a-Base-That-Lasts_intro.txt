So, you've entered a new and exciting world. It's your first night and you're walking aimlessly, torch out and hacking at trees as you pass by.&nbsp;<p><br></p><p>"Well this is easy", you think to yourself as a couple of minutes pass by uneventfully.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, out of the trees appear ghastly shapes, they surround you, squealing and calling in delight. You feebly attempt to attack them, but you have no where to run to, no where to hide.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>That is the fate that awaits you if you don't build a base in <i>The Forest.&nbsp;</i></p>
