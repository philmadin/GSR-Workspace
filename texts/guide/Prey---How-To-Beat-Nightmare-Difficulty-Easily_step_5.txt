<h3>Over Powered</h3> When you're getting the hang of surviving, you should now try to dominate your enemies easily. To do this, you will want to invest in Phantom Genesis (max rank), Machine Mind (max rank) and optionally - Kinetic Blast (max rank). This is essentially a pet build. You sit back while your minions do the fighting. No weapons needed. 
The only thing that would be extremely beneficial for this build is investing in Psi building abilities.
