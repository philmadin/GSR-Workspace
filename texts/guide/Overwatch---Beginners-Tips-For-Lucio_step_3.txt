<h3>Speed Boost!</h3>One of Lucio's signature buffs, Crossfade:Speed allows nearby teammates to move faster by 30%. By using this at the start of a match, you can help slower players to the objective much quicker than usual. Combining this with his Amp It Up ability can help with an organized push onto a point or avoiding certain ultimates. If no one needs healing, keep this active and switch as needed.
