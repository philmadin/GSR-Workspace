Blood-Queen Lanaâ€™thel opens with a nasty tactic before the mission begins; biting you, changing your hero power to a zero mana Vampiric Bite that increases a minion's attack power. Using your hero power is mandatory and if you don't have minions on the board, it will buff her minions instead.

The trick with this fight is to always have enough minions on your side of the board. An easy hero that can manage this is Hunter, as he has plenty of low-cost minions and abilities that can buff each other while focusing on face damage. 

Most decks can manage her as long as they have a minion each turn that is not bitten. She will attempt to change your cards into spells but try to turn them into opportunities instead.
