Your first step to preventing this horrible demise? Gather as much as you can from the plane wreckage and high tail it out of there as soon as you can. Sticking around will only lead to cannibals coming to investigate. From here, finding the perfect location is an absolute must to your survival in game. 

Avoid area's with little to no tree's - although this can be a great spot to build if you're in multiplayer and have the armed forces to protect it - building in a spot like this is a beacon signal for curious island natives. Which will probably not take to you as well as you want them too. Using tree's and foliage for cover from patrols and rouge cannibals can really boost your chances of surviving. 

Building near water is your next must. Across the map there are a fair few ponds which have fish and spears next to them. Take advantage of this food and water source and build a tree house or cabin nearby. 

Try to choose a sheltered area! Using rock faces, lakes, cliffs and the ocean are all great, natural defences which can protect your base from an angle that you don't need to worry about defending, making it easier to protect in the long run.
