<h3>Old Demon King</h3>

Residing at the base of Smouldering Lake, the Old Demon King looks mean, but is slow and leaves lots of opportunity to attack.

At first, he’ll be curled up on the floor like a corpse, but step closer and arise he will. If you have fought the Stray Demon atop the Farron Perimeter or the few Fire Demons located in Undead Settlement and upon entering the Smouldering lake, this will be simple. He leads with his oversized Axe and can hit for high damage, but like his fellows mentioned above, he isn’t very fast. Dodge his axe every time unless you’re carrying a particularly powerful shield. Let him attack, dodge towards him, land some hits, repeat.

If the Demon begins bonking his Axe hilt into the ground he is attempting to summon a circle of flame that pushes outward from the Axe. Back off and you can avoid it but should you not make it, a simple block with your shield will negate enough of the damage. Another fire threat he poses is where the Demon King summons floating fire orbs high above that float down, tracking you slightly. They hurt individually but getting hit with one can lead to several hits then death, so simply move out of their way. They aren’t very fast or accurate, just a lot of them so watch and learn where they tend to land.

Aiming for his tail is helpful as it has a larger than normal hitbox and sticks out a fair way. Aiming for the tail will provide you with some distance from the Axe and vision of what the Demon King is doing next.

Great Swamp Cuculus’s summon for the fight should you need it is just outside the fog gate. Knight Slayer Tsorig, the NPC Invader from the rope bridge way back in the Catacombs is available near the closest Bonfire.
