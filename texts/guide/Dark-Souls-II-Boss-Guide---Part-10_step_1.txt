<h3>Dragonriders</h3> I guess we didn’t make our point before because now there are two of them in one fight. Oh well, the fight isn’t much different than before and now you know how to fight them.

The difference this time is that one will be on your level and another above firing large arrows. Both are incredibly weak, especially to Strike attacks like before.

The first half of the fight is like before but you'll have to dodge those great arrows from above. Whittle down the first Dragonrider to about half and the second will jump down to help his friend. The second is even weaker than the first so if you can defeat or severely weaken the first Dragonrider the second won't be an issue.
