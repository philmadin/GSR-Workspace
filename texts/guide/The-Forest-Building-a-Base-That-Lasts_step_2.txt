Once you have your location, the next step is to set up food racks, water collectors and traps. These are a definite must have regardless of where you build, and without them you won't live long. Water collectors are filled by rain, which sometimes seems far and few between, hence the prior recommendation to live near a fresh water source. Build more than just one of each while you have the chance. Food racks are a lure for being knocked down by angry cannibals. 
Fire in game is also great for preparing food and water, and a basic fire pit is also a must have for every base. Just keep in mind that the light attracts cannibals, so don't go overboard with it unless you want some unexpected visitors!
