In this area near the zipline, there is sometimes a ladder which leads to the top floor. It doesn't always spawn, so if it doesn't, there's still a way to get down quickly.

If you stick to the wall, you can jump onto the aircon unit and climb down the various parts of the wall to reach the ground safely. But that's impractical. I personally have the Uppers skill aced, which allows me to come back to life instantly if I die near a first aid bag. So I leave a first aid bag where the ladder usually is, and just fall off. This may or may not work for you.
