The final boss is Sindragosa, the undead ice dragon. Sindragosa's trick is to render your side of the board useless with blocks of ice. At 20 and 10 health, she will transform all minions into ice that can't be removed. She will also cast Unchained Magic which will deal damage to your hero for any spell in hand. So how do you beat her if you can't play minions? Play fast or play with weapons.
Warrior is a great choice with plenty of weapons and armour for protection. Choose his best weapons and upgrade them with either minions or spells. Use the minions to trade into Sindragosa's own to keep your side clear before each health milestone. Add in some finishing cards and you will have a shiny new card pack.
