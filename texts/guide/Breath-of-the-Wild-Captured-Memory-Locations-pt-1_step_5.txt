<h3>A Premonition</h3> Is one of the trickier ones to get to, as itâ€™s on a rocky outcrop south west of Death Mountain - Death Mountain itself is locked in the north east corner of the map. Travel to Woodland Stable, take the road to the foot of the mountains, and look for a valley heading up the mountain. Head up the valley, climb the first cliff on your left to see a circle of stones and then head north to climb more cliffs to see a second circle of stones. You should find the memory there.
