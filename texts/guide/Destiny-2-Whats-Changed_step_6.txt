<h3>Other changes</h3> There are a few other changes that warrant mention. There are new enemy types for each of the factions, alongside new abilities for familiar units which will keep you on your toes. Levels on item drops are finally calculated on gear you are carrying, not equipped. It’s possible to automatically scramble up ledges, meaning fewer frustrations from missed jumps. We also FINALLY get a matchmaking system for the high-level activities that MMOs are known for, and the first game lacked. ‘Guided Games’ allows clan members (‘Guides’) to invite solo players (‘Seekers’) to join them for raids and Nightfall missions.
