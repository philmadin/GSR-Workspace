With the latest section of the Icecrown Citadel opening up, heroes will now face three more bosses in this adventure. Players will receive a free Frozen Throne card pack for overcoming the challenge. <br><br>Taking down Sindragosa, Blood-Queen Lanaâ€™thel and Professor Putricide won't be easy. Don't limit yourself to the one deck; you don't need an optimal deck to defeat them. Sometimes even the silliest decks can topple a boss. <br>
