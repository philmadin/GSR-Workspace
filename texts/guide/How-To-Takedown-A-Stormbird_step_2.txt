<h3>Weapons Ready</h3>

You will want to have upgraded your weapons to the Shadow versions before tackling the Stormbird. You can still use basic weapons but it will be a matter of time, rather than efficiency. I suggest the Shadow Hunter Bow and Shadow Sharpshoot Bow, due to their Tear focused ammo. I found that the Stormbird stayed out of range when trying to use the Ropecaster. Only use the Ropecaster if it is grounded.
