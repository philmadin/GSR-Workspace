<h3>Seamless Maps and Fast travel</h3> The map in Destiny 2 is much more useful than the vague mess we got in Destiny. You can view a fully-fledged map for each of the open areas by pressing and holding the button for the director. The map marks adventures, public events, lost sectors to explore and even offers fast travel points. Enemies spawn quicker and public events are much more common, meaning thereâ€™s always something to do. Daily bounties are also handled automatically, meaning no more trips to Xander 99-40.
