Partway through the mission, a helicopter may drop a shipping container in the middle of the outside area, near the front gate. While it doesn't always drop, it will always contain a very heavy artifact when it does, so it's a little more effort to sneak out undetected with it. If you are nearby when you get detected and need to run to the exit, it may be worth spending your 60 seconds to carry it all the way to the van.
