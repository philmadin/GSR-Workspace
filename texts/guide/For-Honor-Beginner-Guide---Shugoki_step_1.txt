<h3>Play Style:</h3> Shugoki is a relentless attacker but doesn't excel at speed. He dishes out massive damage and is a disabler/hard hitter.

<h3>Tactics:</h3> Start with Charge of the Oni (an uninterruptable charge) towards the enemy. This will knock down anyone in your way and you can then quickly attack the opponent before he/she gets time to react. The charge can also knock down opponents off cliffs which is an instant kill most of the times.

Shugoki is sluggish and hence open to counterattacks so learn to time your hits. If the enemy is in range, you can unleash an uninterruptable heavy strike which does massive damage. Keep blocking enemy attacks until they're out of stamina and then unleash a heavy strike.

Time your guard breaks as the enemies generally try to maintain their distance while playing against Shugoki. Counter enemy guard breaks by your light attacks.

Shugoki has a trump card which makes him potentially overpowered. This is called the Demon's Embrace. When the attack hits, it leeches the enemies health and replenishes your own. But when it misses, you lose a substantial amount of health. If the Shugoki is below one health bar, and the Demons Embrace hits, it will one shot the opponent. But it is easy to see the move coming and dodge. Hence, if it misses, you're left vulnerable for execution.

<h3>Tips:</h3> Do NOT keep spamming light and heavy attacks. This is easy to defend against and will drain your stamina renderring the already slow Shugoki almost useless. Know your combos, and try to chain attacks. Try not using the Demon's Embrace until your health starts to flash red. Finally, keep an eye on the stamina. Go defensive when you're about to run out.

Some of the tactics might not be particularly "honorable" but the game has a steep learning curve so you have to start somewhere.
