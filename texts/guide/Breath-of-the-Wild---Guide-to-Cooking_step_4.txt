Elixirs work like food in that they give you beneficial status effects, only without the healing component. This is where all those critters and monster parts you’ve been collecting come in - although understanding how they work is a little bit tricky. Critters dictate the effect, monster parts decide the duration, and then it depends on if the elixir provides an absolute effect or a degree of effectiveness.
Buffs such as attack, speed and stealth are absolute, so always stack multiple monster parts with a single critter. The rarer a monster part is, the higher the duration it will provide.
Resistance to the elements on the other hand vary between low, mid and high-level effectiveness. If you want a weak effect for a long period of time, add a single critter with multiple monster parts. Conversely four critters with a single monster part will be more powerful, but won’t last near as long. Keep in mind however that they must be the same critter for this to work.
