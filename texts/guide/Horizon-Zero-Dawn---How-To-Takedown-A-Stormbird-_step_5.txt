You may feel overwhelmed initially. It is one of the few flying enemies, it has heavy attacks and a lot of armour. Always keep your eyes on it, then you can start to predict its attacks. Focus on its Lightning Gun on the centre of its chest. This is the main cause of trouble and once removed, the Stormbird will mostly hover in the sky until it lands.

Watch for its Shock Dive and Wind Gust attacks. These will take big chunks of health and happen very quickly. Once the Stormbird is on the ground, use the Ropecaster to target the Blaze Canisters for extra damage. After this, just keep shooting its weak points until it is dead. It is a battle of patience and endurance. Stay alerted and you will win.
