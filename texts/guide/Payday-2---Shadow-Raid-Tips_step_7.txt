In the outdoor area, there's a red shipping container on top of two others that can't be reached by conventional means. There's often a crowbar and/or a bag of money in here, so it's often worth getting to. To get up here, climb on top of the barrels behind it to reach the top of the adjacent shipping crate. Then, jump across so you're standing next to the red one. You can open it by facing it through the wall. It's a little bit cheaty, but it seems to be the only way to open it. Then, you can jump back across, and across again into the container.
