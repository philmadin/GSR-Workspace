<h3>Smeargle</h3> Make sure you have the right Pokémon in your party. You’ll need someone who can stand up to very long battle, constantly knocking out Pokémon and reducing them down to low HP. Your best choice would be a Smeargle with the moveset: False Swipe, Recycle, Recover, and Icicle Spear (or another damaging move). 
Don’t forget to give it a leppa berry. When your Smeargle runs low on PP, it will use the leppa berry. All you have to do then is use recycle to get it back.
