<h3>Choosing your recipient hero</h3> I would suggest picking a high level/ high rarity hero for inheritance. This is not often an easy task. The reason why I suggested a high level/high rarity hero is because they have the highest attributes(HP, attack, speed, defence, resistance) that can be more effectively coupled with their skills. 
Each individual hero is suited for countering only a select few foes. For example, a bow user hero who has high resistance can be the best counter against a magic user foe who often has low defence.
