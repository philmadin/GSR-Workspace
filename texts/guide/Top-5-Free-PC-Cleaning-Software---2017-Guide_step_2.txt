<h3>2. DEFRAGGLER</h3> If CCleaner cleans your room, then Defraggler organises it.
Imagine for a second, that you have lost your birth certificate. You search for it in your tidy bedroom, but nothing is organised. You don't know where to look and it could take hours.
If you had organised your room earlier, you'd know exactly where to look. It could take seconds. 
This is where Defraggler will come in handy. Defraggler essentially organises your room (computer) and brings the files closer together. In turn, this will speed up the computer.
