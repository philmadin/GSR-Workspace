<h3>Aldia, Scholar of the First Sin</h3> Aldia was included as a possible final boss with Scholar of the First Sin. His attacks are bizarre and indirect compared to most others.

Think of Aldia as more of a sorcerer, his attacks aren’t going to be an axe to the face but a form of magic that he’ll use to hit you at distance. Luckily he doesn’t move once he has teleported and many of his attacks are quite slow. He does produce a fire barrier shortly after teleporting which lowers damage dealt significantly.

His main attacks are his limbs. He will thrust them into the ground causing roots to pop up from the ground around you or sometimes with explosive surprises. Just as common is for Aldia to raise his limbs above him summoning either four smaller homing fireballs or one giant one. Both are dangerous but avoidable. In the case of the large fireball, simply evade as you would any spell. The smaller ones home on you so don’t get complacent when you’ve dodged that first one. 

To attack Aldia, wait for him to teleport, or for his fire barrier to go down. Waiting for the teleport is easier however as the risk is much lower. Once he teleports, scan the room quickly and as soon as you see him sprint over and whack him a few times then back off as his fire barrier can hurt you. 

Repeat this process and Aldia will fall.

Well Done. With Aldia defeated you are free to assume the Throne of Want, or ignore it. As far as the main story goes, you have murdered your way to the end. Congratulations!
