Each of the 48 courses has a shortcut, some more obvious than others. I won't go into details on how to find each one but it's worth noting that they are there. While none are as big as the good old Wario Stadium or Rainbow Road in the '64 days, they do exist and can be used to shave a couple of seconds off, especially if you're setting lap records in time trial mode. One generally universal shortcut tip, however, is to use mushroom speed boosts to boost over sections like grass/gravel that would normally slow you down.
