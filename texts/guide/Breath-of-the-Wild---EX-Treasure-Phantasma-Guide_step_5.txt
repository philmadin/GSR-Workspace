The Phantom Greaves are located with the Hyrule Garrison Ruins. There are two Stalking Guardians wandering around about so make sure youâ€™re careful when navigating to the chest. Either kill them or try to keep out of their line of sight. The chest itself is near a small burnt down shack just to the south of the ruins.
Here is the location on the map above.
