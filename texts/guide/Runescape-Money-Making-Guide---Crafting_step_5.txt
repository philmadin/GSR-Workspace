<h3>Level 76: Decorated fishing urn (nr) (+1,809gp)</h3> One of the best methods if you want to AFK. Decorated fishing urns require two pieces of Soft clay, which cost approximately 978gp for both. You can then mould these into a Decorated fishing urn (unf) and then fire it into a Decorated fishing urn (nr) - turning a profit of 1,809gp per item.
You will need a Portable crafter for this. This method generates a decent amount of XP and gold - great for AFKing too!
