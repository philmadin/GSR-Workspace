<h3>Always choose Hero Bodyguard when an option</h3>

Whenever you die, you may see a new option showing a Hero Bodyguard (On the Rebels you spawn on Leia, on the Imperials you spawn on The Emperor).

The Rebel Guards use a Blaster Rifle and the Imperial ones have a Long Range Rifle (both sides also carry a Smart Rocket and Homing Shot). 

The Bodyguards are essentially Soldiers who have Hero health and damage, which make them incredibly useful in soaking up damage while inflicting more on your enemies.
