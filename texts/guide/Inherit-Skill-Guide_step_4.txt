Selecting the skills:

In the case of the bow user example mentioned earlier, it is often the case that there are 2 or more empty skill slots that do not contain a default skills to be learned using SP. It is not necessarily important that an empty slot be chosen to inherit a skill into. Sometimes just replacing a default skill with another skill can also make the hero perform much better in certain situations. The easiest way to decide what skill to inherit is by checking the hero's attributes. It is most effective to pick a max level In the bow user's case, a passive skill that amplifies its high resistance or a special skill that uses the already high resistance to deal more damage will be a wise choice. For example, if the bow user is low on attack, the high resistance it has can be taken advantage of. By inheriting a special skill such as 'Chilling Wind' that adds the resistance of the hero to its attack when its special skill is triggered can be quite effective. Piling on to this, adding a weapon skill such as a 'Killer bow' can reduce the cooldown of that special skill trigger which can prove the hero to be quite devastating to magic user foes. It is also a good option during battle to let the magic user foe to attack this bow hero first as each attack targeted on the bow hero will trigger the special faster while keeping the damage taken to a minimum due to high resistance.
