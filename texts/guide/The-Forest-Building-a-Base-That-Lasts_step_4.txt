Finally, add defences. Defences in game can be traps, walls or walkways. Defensive fences are great for overall protection, but reinforcements on these walls are definitely a must for any player; whether that means traps or a second wall layer is a choice entirely up to the player. Get creative with your defences as it's satisfying to hear the cannibals outside and not inside your base! 
Remember to use your natural defences to the bases advantage as well, such as building a lookout on a particularly high hill, or having a raft built in as part of your base for an easy get away. 
Overall, building a base in The Forest is really about finding your own style of play, as well as your own in game experience. It takes hours to find the perfect base location, and hours upon hours more to create it! But by following the tips above, it'll be much easier to start your journey into the wilderness, with -hopefully- only a couple of deaths.
