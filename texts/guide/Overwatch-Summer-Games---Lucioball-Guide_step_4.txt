Speed is a factor in this game. Lucio's ability, Amp It Up, is on an increased cooldown timer so you should plan carefully when to use it. For example, you can use it to help contest the ball at the start of every recess or give chase. 
Save his ultimate for key moments: a surprise attack on the goal or going after someone else who has used theirs. It comes down to the moment and making the best judgement like any game.
Have fun and work together with your team.
