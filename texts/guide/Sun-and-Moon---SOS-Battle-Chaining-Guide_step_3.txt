<h3>Adrenaline Orb</h3> Lower the Pokémon’s HP as much as possible and use an Adrenaline Orb. By doing this, you’ll increase the chances that the Pokémon will call for help, which is what you want. If no ally is called during the turn, just use another Adrenaline Orb. It won’t decrease your stock or affect the other Pokémon.
