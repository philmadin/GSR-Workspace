<h3>Counter</h3> The warlord is countered by the faster classes or classes with good range. All his heavies are slow and easily parried. Keep your distance from the warlord as his gap closer, the headsplitter, is predictable. Keep in mind that you don't want to trade heavies with warlord as he does a lot of damage. Side dodge and use fast attacks to shut down the Warlord. Keep your guard to your right to shut out his zone attack and stay far away from environmental hazards.
