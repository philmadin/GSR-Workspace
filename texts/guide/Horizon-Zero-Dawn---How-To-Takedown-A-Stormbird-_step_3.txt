<h3>Dodge, Dip, Duck, Dive And Dodge</h3> The Stormbird remains mostly aerial through the fight and uses devastating shock attacks of both the direct and AOE variety. Always try to keep the camera focused on it as it will dive at your location to begin its ground attacks. Roll, run and use the environment to your advantage to block the attacks.
