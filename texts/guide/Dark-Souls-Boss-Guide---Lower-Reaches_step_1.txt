Capra Demon

Be prepared to die, a lot. Waiting at the end of Lower Undead Burg the Capra Demon will attack you the moment you step through his fog door. Not only this but he has two dogs with him that will also swarm you on sight. Capra Demon’s attacks using his two Demon Machetes are so sever that you may even be killed within a few seconds of entering the arena.

So, what to do? Well, instead of blocking his attacks you’ll want to dodge them. Dodge the attack and you’ll conserve some stamina to dodge again and again whereas taking a hit against your shield will probably drain your stamina so dramatically, one more hit would break your guard and leave you open to death.

Also, whilst dodging him at first, try not to lock onto him. The camera will try its darnedest to follow him while locked on so trying to roll could put you in danger again. So, don’t lock on, roll, and aim to run up those stairs off to the left. Sprint up till you feel safe and now we can fight off those dogs. They are weak, like the ones outside, so dispatch them very quickly. With the dogs gone now we can focus on Mr Capra.

Keep an eye on his attacks. If he raises both Machetes together back off and let him miss you, this attack goes right through a shield. If he prepares to lunge at you, back off cause this attack will likely flatten you and drain half your health. Basically don’t let him touch you, easier said than done in a small arena but it’s important he not get control of the fight. Lure him around as best you can, either up the stairs where he will fall down and be susceptible to more plunging attacks or just by ducking and weaving through his assault till you can land blows of your own.

His health pool is not all that high so it shouldn’t take many hits to kill him. Jut make sure you don’t get over anxious and land too many attacks. Stamina is your friend and if you let it run out you’ll only be hurting yourself as Capra Demon has a fetish for people without any stamina.
