<h3>Hit The Weakspot</h3>

The first priority should be the weapons on a Thunderjaw since they can all deal significant damage. Remove both Disc Launchers on its back, two cannons near its mouth and then the tail component. Use Tearblast arrows on these components otherwise it will take longer than necessary. This is only the beginning, try not to die yet.
