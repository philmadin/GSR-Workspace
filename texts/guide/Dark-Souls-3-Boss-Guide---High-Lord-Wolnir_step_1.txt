<h3>High Lord Wolnir</h3>

Touch the goblet and be transported to a black, sloped arena. High Lord Wolnir will crawl towards you from the darkness and you’ll see the weakness straight away. His wrists have glowing gold bracelets that need to be destroyed to cause damage. But don’t get cocky, you need to plan a little first.

Wolnir’s methods of attack are dangerous, but easily avoidable. Should he raise an arm in any form to attack, just watch it and dodge/block at the right time. Should he raise his body and head very high up, run away as far as possible to avoid his black fog that will kill you within seconds. Wolnir may also lift his left arm high above then smash it down with a black magic effect. This raises skeletons to attack you. At first they are just annoying but if he does this again and again, the skeletons begin to become overwhelming. You’ll start to meet Bonewheel Skeletons, Ninja Skeletons, Heavy Weapon Skeletons.

You want to attack his right hand first. This is the one he holds back a lot more often so break his right hand bracelet first as quickly as possible. When he crawls forward after an attack is your best chance. Once that bracelet is gone, move to his left wrist and do the same twice. That’s all there is, each bracelet removes a huge portion of his health. Your biggest threat is speed. Should you linger too long in the fight, taking too long between bracelet destructions, the chance for more Skeletons to be summoned increases as does the threat of higher classed Skeletons. Don’t dawdle, smash his baubles and grab the Pyromancy Tome in the middle of the arena.
