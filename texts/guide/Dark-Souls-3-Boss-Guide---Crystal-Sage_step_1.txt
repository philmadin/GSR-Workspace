<h3>Crystal Sage</h3>

Crystal Sage deals high damage if any magic connects, so don’t let it. As soon as you run into the fight, sprint up to him and hack away. After a few hits Sage teleports away. This process is the same until halfway. Just be aggressive and get away from his magic. He may attempt to physically assault you but this isn’t common. Assume the best and attack. Notice he uses purple magic.

From halfway the Sage will summon several copies of himself. Each will use typical blue sorceries that are extremely lethal. Crystal Soul Spears, Soul Showers, all the good stuff. The real Sage still uses purple magic so look for that and attack. You can hit the Sage copies that die instantly upon taking damage or beeline straight for the real Sage, either method is solid. Just be aware of the locations of all the Sages and where you’ll be safe when moving around.

The fight is one that can end very quickly so prepare with magic resistance and upgrade your weapon to at least level 2 and maybe add some resins. You want to do high damage quickly. If you’re struggling, bring along Eygon of Carim, the man with the giant hammer. His sign is in the room before the boss arena.
