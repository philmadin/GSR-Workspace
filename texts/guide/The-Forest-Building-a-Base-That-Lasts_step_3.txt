Now that you've got enough food and water equipment in place to set you up for the somewhat foreseeable future, it's time to build your house! It's definitely recommended that you start off smaller, that way you can add onto it later. Starting off too big can cause a lot of problems, especially in single player. 
While you can custom build, there are really two distinct styles of houses to choose from in The Forest. The tree house, or your normal house (which can also be raised on stilts). Keep in mind that the higher or bigger you build your house, the more logs are needed! So this means more effort is needed to gather supplies (the log sled is handy in this situation!). 
Choosing which style of house you want can also lead to different styles of game-play. For example, a tree house is much smaller and less noticeable to cannibals than a large stilted house. Make the decision on how you want to play!
