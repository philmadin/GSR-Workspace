<h3>Toad</h3> Toad, the mushroom-based character that you either love or hate is back, and he brings super fast feet to the table. Toad is the easiest character to unlock and is done simply by linking your 'My Nintendo' account. If you don't have one it's easy to create and is doable from within the app itself. Toad doesn't bring anything special aside from his extra speed, which in Toad Rally is invaluable. Being able to collect more coins and perform more tricks than most other characters definitely helps to bring in those fans.
