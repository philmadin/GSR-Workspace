<h3>5th Figure - The Vision</h3> This area is full of enemies so be careful around this spot. South of Sunfall is the next location for this artifact. Once you find the Broadhead site, you know that you are close to the location. Keep an eye out for the markings and a wooden pole that marks the start of this climb.
