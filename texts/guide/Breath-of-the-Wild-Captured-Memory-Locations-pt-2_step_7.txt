<h3>Zelda’s Awakening</h3> Is the bonus memory that’s unlocked once you’ve captured all of the previously mentioned memories. Speak to Impa back in Kakariko Village, and she will give you a clue for the final memory in the form of a painting on the wall. Travel to the Dueling Peaks Stable and head east towards Hateno Fort. This should take through the sea of ruined guardians, and you’ll find the memory close to the centre of the graveyard.
