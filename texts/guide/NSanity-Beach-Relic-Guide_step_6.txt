It is very important that you take the right pathway as the bridge will spawn two more time adding boxes that will give you a whopping 6 extra seconds. You don't need to jump on top of them, all you need to do is have the invincible Aku Aku mask on and wait a second after activating the bridge. Once the bridge is about halfway spawned sprint across it and the boxes will automatically implode after you step on them.
