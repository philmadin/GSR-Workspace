<h3>Classes</h3> Character classes have seen a huge overhaul. Starting with a single subclass, you unlock the subsequent subclasses by finding ‘Class Relics’. These start dropping randomly once you hit levels seven and fourteen, and are charged by killing things or participating in events. You choose the kind of grenade, jump, melee and the new class ability as before, but the stat changing skills are gone – they’re all handled by mods. Instead, each subclass has a further two specialisations which really change how that subclass plays. The Warlocks Voidwalker, for example, can choose between AOE damage or survivability/crowd control, with each of these modifying your rechargeable abilities.
