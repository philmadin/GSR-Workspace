Skills, Builds and Stats
 
If you’re planning on levelling solo then at least one slot should be reserved for a healing skill.
The additional mods are entirely up to you –I personally went with damage and then overheal as they became available. This is a useful skill for both solo and group play as you can pick and choose from the skill perks depending on the situation.
Secondary skill for solo I would have to recommend either the Pulse Skill or Smart Cover. Pulse is great as it pings everyone on the map and Smart cover as it can also be adjusted via mods to suit solo or group play with the choice of extra healing or damage.
When playing in groups it is absolutely essential for you to work well with your team (you can see what skills they have chosen on the bottom right corner of your HUD). Try not to double-up on skills, there’s no use having 2 members running Pulse for example when someone could run something else like Turrets or the like and give your team more firepower to clear missions quicker!
When it comes to choosing stats there’s really only 2 you should really focus on while levelling: Health (Stamina) and DPS (Firearms). You really only need to focus on these for now –save the min/maxing for when you hit level 30. There are, of course, some things that will immediately help you. Gear with +xp, +ammo, or +first aid are definite ones that you can look at, as long as you aren’t sacrificing your 2 main stats by too much. It’s a different ballgame once you hit max level so enjoy the relatively simple stat setup while it lasts!
