<h3>Beginning</h3> At the beginning, you will want to unlock Neuromod fabrications to create your own neuromods. 
To do this, gather all of the neuromods you can find in the Lobby (Trauma Center, Sales Division, IT Department). Then read all of the emails that you find in the rooms right next to Morgan Yu's office (Executive Suites). You will need a code from these emails for the next part.
Once you do this, you will have enough neuromods to unlock Hacking I, II and III. Head back to the starting area (the room before entering the lobby) and use the GLOO gun to hop to the second floor. Use the code you found in the Lobby to access the Volunteer Quarters room. Once you can access to this room, you will be able to enter the Fabrication room - finding the neuromod fabrication plans.
