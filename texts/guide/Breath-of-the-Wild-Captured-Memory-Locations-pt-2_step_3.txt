<h3>Slumbering Power</h3> Is located in the Spring of Power in the Akkala region, and the best place to start is at the East Akkala Stable. This is on the way to the Akkala Ancient Tech Lab, and if you head due west from the stable you should find the spring sunken into the ground. Look for a plinth in front of the water to locate the memory.
