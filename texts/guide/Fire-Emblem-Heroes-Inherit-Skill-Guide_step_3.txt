<h3>Understanding skills</h3> It is crucial that you understand more about skills before you choose a skill for the hero. There are six different types of skills that a hero can have in battle. In most cases, the heroes are already bestowed with four skills and two empty skill slots when you acquire them. 
The highest rarity (5-star) heroes often have their default skills maxed out and are available for learning. 'Maxed out' does not mean that they are available during battle. It simply means they can be learned and equipped to be used in battle. Skills can learned using SP (skill points). SP is earned each time a hero levels up and/or when the hero defeats a foe. Lower rarity heroes will have some default skills locked from being learned unless they are unlocked through the 'Unlock Potential' option.
