<h3>Ludex Gundyr</h3>

Your first opponent is right around the corner and he will give a good demonstration as to what to expect from here on. Ludex is still as a statue until you pull the Coiled Sword out from him. Once he’s up though, Ludex wields a large Halberd and can move surprisingly slickly.

In the first half of the fight, get used to dodging his attacks and positioning yourself on his left hand side. His Halberd can still hit you here but less easily. For melee fighters, use the moments in between attacks to get one, maybe two hits in then retreat and let him make the next move. Too many attacks and he’ll likely crush you with your empty stamina bar. For ranged fighters, same idea but create some distance, enough to fire off a spell, arrow, firebomb etc. At a distance he will have more chance to be hit.

Repeat till his health breaches half and Ludex will become the host of a large, black slug creature that wraps itself around Ludex and increases his attack range greatly. Ludex is also more aggressive from here, chasing after you and recovering from attacks faster and pressuring you into mistakes. Staying behind him is a good idea. The large black entity is mostly a frontal aggressor, leaving you a greater window to get a hit or two in. However, an attack from the Black Slug is very powerful so even one hit can chain into several. Try your best to dodge to his right hand side when he attacks. If he jumps into the air, dodge to his left hand side.

Watch that stamina bar, let Ludex make the first move and only attack sparingly. There is a Bonfire right outside so there’s no need to rush.
