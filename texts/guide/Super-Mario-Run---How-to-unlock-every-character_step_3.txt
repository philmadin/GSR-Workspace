<h3>Yoshi</h3> Everyone's favourite dinosaur Yoshi is unlocked by purchasing a house called 'Yoshi's House' and placing it in your kingdom. In order to purchase his house, you must collect 30 red and 30 yellow toads in Toad Rally. Yoshi brings his signature air kicks, which lift him back into the air for a short period of time. Once again tap and hold to activate his ability while airborne, and you'll find those platforms will be a lot easier to stay on in the sky levels. Yoshi is also impervious to spikes, allowing him to be unaffected by those pesky Pokeys and other spike-afflicted creatures.
