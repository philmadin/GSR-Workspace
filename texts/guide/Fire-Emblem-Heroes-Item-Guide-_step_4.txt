<h3>STAMINA POTIONS, DUELING CRESTS and LIGHT'S BLESSINGS:</h3> Dueling crests, Stamina potions and Lightâ€™s Blessings are pretty rare items, mostly gained by completing monthly challenges.

Stamina is an absolute necessity if you're looking to spend extended periods of time playing Fire Emblem: Heroes. Your Stamina is depleted every time you play a match, at varying levels depending on the difficulty. Your Stamina replenishes on it's own in just under five hours, but if you're in the zone, empty a Stamina Potion to continue your trail of dominance.

Dueling Swords are basically your ammo for playing in the Arena. Unfortunately you're only able to carry three swords at a time, which limits your play to three matches. Considering you need a seven win streak to earn your sweet, sweet Hero Feathers, using up a Dueling Crest can keep your momentum going.

Light's Blessings are basically the 'get out of jail free card' of Fire Emblem: Heroes. If you come up against a formidable enemy and your army is wiped out, a Light's Blessing can be used to replenish your health while keeping the damage you've already inflicted on your foe.
