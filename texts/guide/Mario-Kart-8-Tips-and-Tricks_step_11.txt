Adding to the previous step, it is possible to throw certain items backwards OR forwards. Green/red shells for example naturally go forwards but by holding down on your control stick they can be fired in reverse. Same goes for bananas and Bob-ombs that normally get dropped behind you but it is possible to fire them forwards by holding up. Just make sure you avoid them when driving past!
