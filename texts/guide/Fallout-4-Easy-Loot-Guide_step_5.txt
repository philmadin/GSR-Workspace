Once you've cleared the bunker, take a look around. There's a fusion core, a number of weapons and, (if you find the key or hack the terminal) access to a room with a safe, a mini-nuke and a copy of the U.S. Cover Operations Manual. Now you're fully equipped to tackle the wasteland and you haven't even levelled up yet. Things can only get better from here.
