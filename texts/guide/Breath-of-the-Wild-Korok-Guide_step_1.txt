First of all, the most important thing is to first find Hestu. A giant chubby Korok that can be found on the road to Kakriko Village, he initially needs you to retrieve his maracas - which are found close by in a bokoblin camp. Get these back, and he'll offer a couple of upgrades, before moving on to a stable (I found him at Wetland Stable in Lanayru). 
Here, he'll offer to upgrade your pouches even further, and once you've done it enough times, he'll finally move on to Korok Forest, which is found within the Great Hyrule Forest, north of Hyrule Castle.
