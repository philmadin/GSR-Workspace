Good news, everyone! Professor Putricide is ready to greet you in this next fight. It is a tricky one with three phases, but, lucky for us a Mage can handle him, no worries. 

Phase One begins with all secrets costing zero. Stuff your deck with some of the mage's best secrets like Counterspell, Duplicate and Iceblock if you're worried. Then add minions that work well with Secrets to increase the value such as Mana Wyrm or Medivh's Valet. Include some tech cards that will counter the Professor's own and you will be a third of the way there.

Next phase is where all weapons cost one. The Professor will summon Festergut and you should take him out immediately as he will damage all your minions each turn. More tech cards like an Ooze will counter his weapon usage. 

By phase three you should have everything under control when all costs are changed to five. He will summon Rotface and you should have the board presence to ignore him and go for face to finish him off.
