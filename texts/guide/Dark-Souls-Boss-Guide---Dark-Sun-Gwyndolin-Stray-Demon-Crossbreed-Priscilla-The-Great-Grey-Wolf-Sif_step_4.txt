The Great Grey Wolf Sif

It’s truly sad bringing down such a majestic beast but, he has an item we need so….

Wielding his masters Greatsword, Sif is no pushover. Large sweeping and smashing attacks mixed with his natural agility make for a rough first time. Getting in underneath his belly is ideal as he can’t hit you from there. If you need to block an attack, make sure to do so with the intent to move backwards as well. His attacks drain a lot of stamina with shield raised so multiple blocks could result in you having your guard broken and taking a sword smash straight to your lovely cheekbones. Specifically, watch out for his spinning attack as this will cut right through a weaker shield and take a good chunk of your health, though it is able to be evaded.

Being without armour of any kind Sif is weak to the Bleed status. In fact he isn’t too fond of any status or element so whatever you feel is best for you is what will work.
