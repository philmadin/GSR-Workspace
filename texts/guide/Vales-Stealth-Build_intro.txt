Fallout 4’s extraordinary build system allows the use of multiple play styles to combat the game in several ways. 
In this guide, I will show you a build that has been tweaked dozens of times to forge the best stealth build to date (IMO).  
This build increases the overall stealth movements for pickpocketing, pick locking and stealth damage.

There are amazing benefits to running a stealth build, such as getting bonus damage, more loot and caps, ability to unlock difficult doors and simply own stuff that wasn’t yours to begin with. 
This build is for people that enjoy taking their time; pickpocketing Fusion Cores out from any Power Armour, forcing the unit out of the suit; placing live grenades in enemies’ pockets; stripping an opponent of all their clothes and weapons before starting a fight. The possibilities aren’t endless, but they sure are entertaining. So let’s get started!
