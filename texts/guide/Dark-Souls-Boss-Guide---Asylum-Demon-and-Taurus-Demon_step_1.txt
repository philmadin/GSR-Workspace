<h3>Asylum Demon</h3> Luckily, or unluckily depending on your view on life, your first confrontation with one of the series many bosses is straight off the bat. After lighting your first Bonfire you’ll go through a pair of giant doors entering a large Hall. Take a few steps and down comes the Asylum Demon. Now, it's possible to kill him at this point, however we’re going to assume you don’t have half an hour to waste. As he lands, run to the left hand side of the room and look for a doorway. This will lead you around to a higher point in the Hall containing the Demon.

This is your first chance at learning something crucial. Just outside the fog gate you’ll notice some messages. They will advise to attempt a plunging attack. So let’s try it, go through the fog gate and look down, there’s Asylum Demon waiting down below. Before he jumps up and smashes you off your perch, take a leap of faith and fly off the edge. On you way down, swing your weapon to initiate a plunging attack. Should it be successful you will lodge your weapon in the Demon’s head, causing sever damage.

From here though you need to fight him one on one. His attacks are big, slow and depending on your character, hard to dodge given your low Soul Level. Focusing on his rump is advised, circling around until he can’t hit you and, whilst he swings and misses, attack one or twice then let your Stamina Recover. Don’t get too greedy, even if his health is down to a sliver, wasting your stamina and leaving yourself open to an attack can be the end of you before you can say “Damn You Asylum Demon!!”.
