<h3>Giant Lord</h3> A boss that’s made complicated by his enormous size, the Giant Lord is similar to the fight with the Last Giant.

You’ll need to be very careful accessing this boss as he resides at the end of a gauntlet of Golems and Soldiers fighting each other with fireballs raining down from the skies and the head of a statue rolling around.

Firstly, if you’re a ranged player, just jump up to the platform on the left once you reach the Lord. Dodge his sword while hurling your attacks from relative safety.

For melee players his foot odour is bad so that’s your goal. Problem is you can’t see his attacks very well from down here. You can try changing what part of him you are locked on to for a better view whilst still attacking his feet, but that’s really personal preference. Watch out for sword swipes at weird angles, you’ll be surprised at how well he can hit you.
