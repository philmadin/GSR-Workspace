<h3>Burnt Ivory King - Charred Army</h3> Burnt Ivory king is more of a spectacle, but a fun one.

The boss itself is available as soon as you reach the Cathedral past Aava, however before the Ivory King arrives, you must fight his Charred Knights. At your disposal are a possible four Loyce Knights to aid you. This can go two ways, first, you simply jump down as soon as you unlock the boss and fight, this will require you to fight all the Charred Knights with only one Loyce Knight at your side. This also means that you will have a constant stream of Charred Knights arriving even when the King arrives. The second way is to find the other three Loyce Knights scattered throughout Eleum Loyce to help you. If all four Knights follow you down you are able to fight the Charred Knight, extinguish each Chaos Portal and cease the flood of Charred Knights when the King arrives. The choice is yours.

If you have chosen to go it alone, well, good luck. This method won’t be covered here as it is suicide for a new player.

Anyway, with our shiny Loyce Knights at our side, let’s jump down. The fight until the Burnt Ivory King arrives is just a group assault. Your Knights fight Charred Knights and gradually your Knights will sacrifice themselves to the Chaos Portals. Be careful as the Charred Knights are ruthless, switching aggro at the drop of a hat and have awkward attack range. Work with your Knights and let them soak up the damage as they are here to die anyway. Try to clean up what they leave behind.
