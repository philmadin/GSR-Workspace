<h3>4. IOBIT DRIVER BOOSTER</h3> The simplest way to explain what a device driver is, is explaining someone who drives a car.
The driver controls all facets of the vehicle. They steer, they accelerate and set a pace. You need a driver if the car is to go anywhere.
The same applies to a device driver. If you plug in a new keyboard or mouse, chances are that they will automatically install drivers when they're connected.
In some cases, devices don't automatically install drivers and they don't update themselves. You NEED to update drivers for hardware to work at peak performance.
Iobit Driver Booster takes the guesswork out of the equation. It automatically searches and installs the drivers that you absolutely need.
It is highly recommended and free to use.
