<h3>Luigi</h3> Luigi, Mario's brother and partner in crime is the taller of the two siblings and consequently has both a higher and longer jump. Like Yoshi he is unlocked by purchasing his respective house and placing it in your kingdom, however, he requires 150 green and 150 purple toads to be collected through Toad Rally before becoming available. Luigi's higher jump is especially useful for reaching the final tier of special coins (black) as they are quite often just out of reach of the other characters. Luigi can also make use of the Mushrooms to power up and take a hit without using a bubble.
