Controlling the ball is needed in this game. By knowing when to use your abilities, it will increase your chance of a goal.
Using his melee attack is perfect for dribbling and stopping immediate shots at short ranges. Although, it doesn't provide the ball with speed and height like his secondary "boop" does. This attack is more suited for getting the ball away quickly in the goal area or passing down to teammates. 
Watch also the angles you shoot from as unexpected bounces and heights make it easier to score a goal.
