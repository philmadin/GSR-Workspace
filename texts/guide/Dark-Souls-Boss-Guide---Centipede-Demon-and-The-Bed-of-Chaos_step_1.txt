Centipede Demon

After the Firesage Demon comes this monstrosity. The Centipede Demon will jump down into the lava from his home on the wall. You can actually see him from the Bonfire just outside the Firesage Boss room.

Initially he will land a fair way away, so take advantage of this and look to your right for a piece of land. Jump across the lava quickly to this bit of land and follow it around the corner. Now make it over to the next chunk of much larger land with some Green Titanite. This is the best position to fight the Demon.

Slowly Centipede Demon will make its way over to you. Once closer, but still at range he will fling one of his heads/arms at you, make sure to dodge this. You’ll need to close the gap and lure him over to your sanctuary. Once you are both together again, it’s fighting time. Your goal should be to chop off his rear tail as quickly as possible. Once severed it will still be alive so kill it and receive the Orange Charred Ring, this will give you high resistance while walking on lava.

Back to the fight, you should now begin to attack his legs. His attacks are rather unfocused and, whilst dangerous, can be avoided by keeping away from his front. If he launches into the air run away and wait for him to land again. That’s basically it, the real danger is from the lava and use of space. Do the fighting on the Green Titanite mound and you should have all the room you need to defeat him.
