<h3>Heal Up!</h3>The other half to Lucio's passive ability is Crossfade: Heal. Like his speed boost, to be effective, the team needs to be within range and sight for them to receive the full benefit of it. Since he provides lower overall healing, he is sometimes better when paired with another healer like Mercy that can focus specific players. His ultimate, Sound Barrier, can be a lifesaver especially on control points, as the dramatic health increase means the team is able to defend for longer.
