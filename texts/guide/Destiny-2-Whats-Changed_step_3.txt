<h3>Consumable Shaders</h3> Shaders are now consumable – yes, you read that right, consumable. They apply to individual items, and can finally be applied to weapons and vehicles for the ultimate in customisability. The drop rates have increased to compensate, and they tend to drop in stacks of 3-5. Keep in mind that they do cost glimmer to apply, and save your legendary shaders for gear you’ll be holding on to.
