<h3>Old Dragonslayer</h3> Ornsteâ€¦ I mean Old Dragonslayer is located past the sleeping Guardian Dragon. Whilst not as quick as his idol, Old Dragonslayer has similar moves with a few additions. Some attacks are more elaborate than previously and he can perform a ground smash attack that unleashes a heavy magic blast.

Keep to his offhand side and make use of his long-winded, far reaching attacks. He leaves himself open to a lot of punishment, so don't hesitate to make him pay. Keep your Stamina in check as it can be tempting to get greedy, tiring you out.

Killing Old Dragonslayer opens the way to the Blue Sentinels Covenant and some neat gear.
