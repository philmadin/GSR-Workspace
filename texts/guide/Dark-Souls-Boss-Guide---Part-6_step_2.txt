<h3>Demon Firesage</h3> Another Stray Demon! Except this time it’s on fire. Don’t worry though, it is the same as the one below the Undead Asylum. Dodge his attacks, block his magic if necessary and smack him in the bum. Things are a little harder here given the smaller confines but if you’ve beaten him under the Undead Asylum it won’t be that much different.
