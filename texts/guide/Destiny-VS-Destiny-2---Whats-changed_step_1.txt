<h3>Weapons</h3> Your Primary, Secondary and Heavy weapon slots are now Kinetic, Energy and Power. Standard weapons such as rifles and pistols fill the Kinetic and Energy slots and are only defined by ammo type. Want to carry and use two Pulse Rifles? No problem! What this does mean, however, is that Secondary and Heavy weapons have been combined into the new Power slot, meaning unless you have a favourite heavy, youâ€™ll be changing loadouts quite often.
