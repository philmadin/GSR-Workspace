Time to Switch it up.
You know how buying a Nintendo Switch at launch was a bad idea, because of the lack of games to support splashing over $400 on a console and one game?
Yeah that has now passed and now is the time to buy, with game of the year candidates like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of The Wild and Super Mario Odyssey as well as a plethora of other amazing games now is definitely the time to buy.
