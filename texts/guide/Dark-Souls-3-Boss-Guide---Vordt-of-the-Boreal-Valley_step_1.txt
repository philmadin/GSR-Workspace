<h3>Vordt of the Boreal Valley</h3>

Don’t make assumptions based on Vordt’s appearance, he’s aggressive, swift and packs a wallop. For the first third of the fight, Vordt will simply try to smash you with his mace. Ignore everything and just stay beneath and behind him. He can’t track you very well at this point, so just stay away from his front and you’ll have ample time to attack. 

By about two-thirds through, Vordt will start using his frost breath and Charge attacks. His frost breath builds up your frost meter quite quickly, granting you a small health loss and poor stamina regeneration. When Vordt starts to glow, shifting his head to the side, run up and pound him to cancel it. When Vordt begins running back and forth across the room you’ll need to be fast and dodge the attacks. He will repeat the run back and forth across the room several times, each causing significant harm. You can only withstand about a few of these so don’t block unless you’re out of options, just dodge.

The final third of the fight is where he reaches his true potential. No longer can you simply admire at his butt and whittle him down. He will have a much wider reach, faster reaction time and deals Frost regularly. Still try to get away from his front, but attack sparingly, especially if you are a light build.

If you manage to kill the naked Uchigatana wielding man outside Firelink Shrine, he will be available to help you as a Summon. His sign will be right outside the fog gate as well as Lion Knight Albert’s.
