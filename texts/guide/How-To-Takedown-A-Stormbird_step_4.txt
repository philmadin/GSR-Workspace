<h3>Weakness</h3>

The main weakness of the Stormbird is Tear. Make sure you are using the correct arrows to help remove components and armor. Once they are removed, it becomes less threatening. The other weaknesses include the freeze and blaze canisters on its body. Target these with fire and freeze arrows to deal extra damage to the body.
