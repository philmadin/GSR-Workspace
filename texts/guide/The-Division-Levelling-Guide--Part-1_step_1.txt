Zones
The map in The Division has been set out in such a way that levelling is generally a straight-forward affair. The Story Missions, Side-Missions and Encounters tend to slowly overlap and push you towards the next appropriate zone in your journey to level 30.
Refer to the following map for a rough idea.
 
The following are general guidelines when it comes to levelling in The Division:
•	If you’re levelling with friends try not to have too much of a level difference! The game will look at your highest level party member and spawn enemies at that level, rather than averaging out your opponents. 
•	For speed-levelling (boosting) from friends this can help get you to max level much faster –but when you want to explore and enjoy the game at a steady pace with your friends this will prove to be more hindrance than help.
•	Complete as many of your story/side missions and encounters as possible! This gives you a great amount of xp and allows you to get a bit ahead of the curve. Expect to be 1-2 levels in front of the next zone on your minimap using this method. From there you can choose to continue along this route or skip the far away encounters/side missions (from level 12 onwards I began to just do the main story missions and any encounters along the way only).
•	This method got me to level 30 in approx. 26 hours played time–not as fast as the fastest of speed runners at the time (this was 4 days after launch)–but a very respectable levelling time overall –and the main template I use for all of my levelling runs.
•	When you complete every mission and encounter in a zone you will get a quest from that zones’ safe-house which tasks you with visiting the next safe-house in your next zone. This is always good to remember as it will give you a nice little xp boost.
