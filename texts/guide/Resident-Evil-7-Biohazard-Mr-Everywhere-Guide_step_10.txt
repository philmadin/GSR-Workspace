After the shadow puzzle in the gallery of the old house, go through the gap that opens to the other side of the large room with the broken floor. Walk to the end of the room like you did in the Mia tape and enter the crawl space. Once in the crawl space, walk down until you come to a shelf on the left of the crawl space. On the top shelf, you will find Mr. Everywhere.
