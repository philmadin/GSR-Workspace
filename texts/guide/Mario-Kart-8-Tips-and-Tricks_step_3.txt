Drifting is key in Mario Kart, it always has been and always will be. The Deluxe edition has 3 stages of drift to achieve, each providing a longer lasting speed boost. Press and hold 'R' on any corner, and you'll begin to see blue sparks coming from your rear wheels. Hold it for longer to get orange sparks, and if you're able to hold it even longer again, pink sparks will appear indicating the maximum achievable speed boost. You're still able to steer while doing so, although bikes and karts handle differently so will require some practice to perfect. Release 'R' at any stage to let go of the drift and rocket forwards.
