The Last Giant

Unlike Dark Souls, there is no welcome Boss, it is in fact a little while before we meet our first. The Last Giant resides at the bottom of the elevator in Forest of the Fallen Giants (FotFG) and may pose a danger to new comers and the ill prepared.

The Giants height is troublesome. You can lock onto him in several spots but all are rather awkward. Too high and you’ll not be able to hit him where you want unless you are using ranged attacks, too low and you may not see his attacks coming. Your best bet is to try not locking on and controlling the camera yourself. 

Aim for his legs and simply hack away as he’s quite clumsy after being stuck down here for so long. His attacks are slow but damaging and can knock you down quite easily. At about half health he will tear off one of his arms and use this as as a sort of club. This doesn’t change things too much, just now he has a greater reach so stick close to his legs and keep out of his arms way. He will use stomping attacks regularly but simply walking away should be enough to evade the attack.

At some point the Giant may simply fall over/try to body slam you, leaving a long period of time for free hits if evaded. Also, don't be afraid to make use of Firebombs, arrows, spells and Witching Urns. These are all available fairly early on and deal decent damage to the Giant.
