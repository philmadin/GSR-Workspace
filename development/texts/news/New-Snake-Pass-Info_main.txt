Sumo Digital have also released the debut episode of its video dev diary series - The Story of Snake Pass - where creator Seb Liese discusses <i>Snake Pass’</i> humble beginnings from an internal game jam project, through development, to its first consumer demo at EGX Rezzed in 2016.<br><br><br>“Sharing the first developer diary is great because it shows how quickly the game evolved. That original prototype already had the feel we wanted, but it was building an actual game around it that became the challenge,” Said Seb Liese, creator of <i>Snake Pass</i>. “Seeing that rudimentary green snake is quite comical now. We worked so hard to turn him into something charming and ended up with the Noodle you see today, a character I hope will resonate with people of all ages!”<br><br><br>At Game Developer Conference 2017, held at the Moscone Centre, in San Francisco from February 27th - March 3rd, <i>Snake Pass</i> will be demoed at the Unreal Engine stand on Nintendo Switch (Booth 1024), Indie MEGABOOTH Showcase on PC and at the Microsoft Lobby Bar on Xbox One. Additionally Snake Pass will be part of the Xbox One Loft Press Event.<br><br><br>When a mysterious intruder threatens the tranquillity of their home, it’s up to Noodle the Snake and Doodle the Hummingbird to embark on a daring journey to save the day. Controlling this dynamic duo, players must ‘think like a snake’ as they slither, curl and climb their way through 15 levels across 4 increasingly challenging themed worlds. <i>Snake Pass</i> is a unique take on the platforming genre that is intuitive and fun to learn, but will gradually test your snake charming skills to the limit!<br><br><br><br>To visit the official <i>Snake Pass</i> website visit: <a href="http://planofattack.us12.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=bb3a3c27095f343ef67c62d5b&amp;id=b4eb8ac688&amp;e=da54437a6b" target="_blank" style="color:#2BAADF; font-weight:normal; text-decoration:underline">www.snake-pass.com</a><br><br>Follow <i>Snake Pass</i> &amp; Sumo Digital on Twitter: <a href="http://planofattack.us12.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=bb3a3c27095f343ef67c62d5b&amp;id=ed65494793&amp;e=da54437a6b" target="_blank" style="color:#2BAADF; font-weight:normal; text-decoration:underline">@Snake_Pass</a> &amp; <a href="http://planofattack.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=bb3a3c27095f343ef67c62d5b&amp;id=a5f530dc2a&amp;e=da54437a6b" target="_blank" style="color:#2BAADF; font-weight:normal; text-decoration:underline">@SumoDigitalLtd</a><br><br>Like <i>Snake Pass</i> on Facebook: <a href="http://planofattack.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=bb3a3c27095f343ef67c62d5b&amp;id=3bd50df6ce&amp;e=da54437a6b" target="_blank" style="color:#2BAADF; font-weight:normal; text-decoration:underline">https://www.facebook.com/SnakePassGame/</a><br><br>
