There is no linear narrative to follow (though there <i>is </i>a story present), and Link can accrue whatever items and skills the player deems necessary in their pursuit of 'Calamity Ganon'.</font></font></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><font face="Ubuntu"><font style="font-size: 11pt" size="2">The massive open-world of Hyrule is ripe for the picking, as Link must salvage everything from the wild if he is to succeed in his mission. Weapons, clothing, food, materials...everything must be pilfered and crafted from the incredibly detailed landscape that stretches before him, not to mention the perils of a fully-realised weather and temperature system which affects how he operates.</font></font></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><font face="Ubuntu"><font style="font-size: 11pt" size="2">That's not all. The young elven lad can now also climb virtually any surface (including cliffs, trees and buildings), ride his shield like a snowboard, jump, and use his 'Sheikah Slate' to mark points of interest!</font></font></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><font face="Ubuntu"><font style="font-size: 11pt" size="2">There are over 100 'Shrines of Trials' that litter the countryside, and these test your courage, wisdom and power by offering new items to play with, such as the metal-manipulating 'Magnesis', and the time-stopping 'Cryonis' tools.</font></font></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><font face="Ubuntu"><font style="font-size: 11pt" size="2">Of course, Amiibo gets a look-in, too. The Wolf Link Amiibo summons the lupine hero into the game world itself, and acts as a partner to the regular Link. Wolf Link can sniff out treasures, and hunt alongside his master. On top of this, three new Amiibo have been introduced with the game; 'Archer' Link, 'Rider' Link and the fearsome 'Guardian'. Their use is still unknown at this <font face="Ubuntu">point</font>.</font></font></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><font face="Ubuntu"><font style="font-size: 11pt" size="2"><i style="font-size: 11pt">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</i> has garnered an incredibly positive reaction so far, and it's easy to see why. Early signs point to another masterpiece from Nintendo, not to mention the inevitable NX version that will launch alongside the current Wii U one. The visuals are astounding, and the ambient noise is unlike anything heard previously in the franchise.</font></font></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><font face="Ubuntu"><font style="font-size: 11pt" size="2"><b><i>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</i> is due out in 2017<font face="Ubuntu">.</font></b></font></font></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><br></p>
