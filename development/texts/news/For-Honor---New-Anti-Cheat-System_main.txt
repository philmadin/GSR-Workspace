<p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">With our commitment to keep a fair experience in For Honor, we've implemented EasyAntiCheat, a program that allows us to identify players who look to cheat or hack their way into better performances on the battlefield. Through this software, we have currently identified and banned less than 400 players in For Honor.</span><br></p><p><br></p><p>An additional 70 players have been banned for offensive emblems, harassment and other misconduct, which has been reported by other players in the game and through our Customer Support portal.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>All bans, whether temporary or permanent, are applied on an account level, not at the hardware level. We have also been delivering bans on first offense as we take our goals of creating a fair environment very seriously. Please note that all bans delivered during our Open Beta (60 in total) were lifted for launch.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Players who may be concerned they are in violation of EasyAntiCheat's rules should consult our Code of Conduct for more detail. After the system flags a player, the team validates the potential cheat/hack, and if confirmed as true, we deliver the sanction. The player in question will receive an email from Ubisoft officially informing them of their sanction, the offense, the platform in question, and how long the sanction will last.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>There is an appeal process available for those who believe their ban was issued in error, and our team reviews each on a case-by-case basis. More information regarding bans can be found on our support page: https://support.ubi.com/en-US/Faqs/000026239/For-Honor-Sanctions-Warnings-Suspensions-and-Bans-FH-PC-XB1-PS4</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>For players in For Honor who are receiving error messages from EasyAntiCheat when entering the game, we have creating this comprehensive troubleshooting guide that will help you resolve each type of issue and get you back to chopping heads and capturing points right away.</p><p></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Source -</b>&nbsp;http://forhonor.ubisoft.com/game/en-US/news-community/152-284823-16/our-approach-to-sanctioning-in-for-honor</p>
