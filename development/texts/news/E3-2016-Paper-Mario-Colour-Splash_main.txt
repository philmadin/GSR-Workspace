<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><font face="Ubuntu"><font style="font-size: 11pt" size="2">Paper Mario is back for more hilarious shenanigans, and his wafer-thin world is in HD for the very first time!</font></font></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><font face="Ubuntu"><font style="font-size: 11pt" size="2">Set on Prism Island, Mario and Peach arrive in order to solve a  gruesome mystery of a folded Toad. Immediately, the skinny-fat plumber finds the location devoid of colour, and teams up with a talking paint can named Huey in order to set things right.</font></font></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><font face="Ubuntu"><font style="font-size: 11pt" size="2">Using his hammer, Mario clobbers scenery with paint in order to fill the gaps, and unlock secrets. Using a paint <font face="Ubuntu">meter</font> comprised of the three primary shades, the game automatically mixes the right colour when filling-in the world, and globs can be collected in order to refill his inventory.</font></font></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><font face="Ubuntu"><font style="font-size: 11pt" size="2">Of course, there's more to this clever system. When exploring Prism Island, Mario collects Battle Cards, and uses these to fight enemies by performing special moves. These black and white slips can be used as is, but the Game Pad can be used in order to colour them, and thus boosting their effectiveness. There are basic ones like jump and hammer smash â€“ and more advanced cards such as enemy recruitment and 'Thing' summons, which return from <i>Paper Mario: Sticker Star</i>.In a neat twist, enemies' health is represented by the amount of colour they have.</font></font></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><font face="Ubuntu"><font style="font-size: 11pt" size="2">Additionally,the world itself is ripe for manipulation. Comprised of cardboard and paper (which looks very sharp on Wii U), scenery is pulled, ripped and rolled in order to open new scenes, and scissors can be used via the Game Pad's touch screen to cut new paths and find hidden Luigis. Hidden Luigis!</font></font></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><font face="Ubuntu"><font style="font-size: 11pt" size="2"><i>Paper Mario: Colour Splash</i> serves as a much-needed boost to the Wii U's bare 2016 software line-up, and promises to bring the good times that only <i>Paper Mario</i> can bring.</font></font></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><font face="Ubuntu"><font style="font-size: 11pt" size="2"><b><i>Paper Mario: Colour Splash</i> is available on October 7<sup>th.</sup></b></font></font></p>
