<b>Segment Seven: Miyamoto Interview</b><p><b><p>Start of the game again. Shigeru Miyamoto is asked why Link always sleeps at the start of the games. In the original Legend of Zelda, you start with not much on yourself, and at the time, people were used to game like Mario where you had what you needed. He decided to go all the way for Zelda, and strip them of everything. This game echoes that .Asks about his vision over three decades and they way tech has evolved. In the old Zelda, they bundled an illustration of Link on a cliff face in order to help players foster their imagination – and now, tech is so advanced that it is better than the drawing. Asked why he never gave players much story in Zelda.. Stream craps out. And I'm back. Asked about his role. His main role is concerned with Link's movement, and how natural everything feels. Oh, and “financials”  too. Says the seared meat remind him of the meat item from the NES version.&nbsp;</p><p>You could fight Ganon in the nude, if you want to. It's that free. Action gets really windy, and Link can start a grass fire to his advantage. Asks if there's anything he was finally able to realise in this game. He says he didn't ask for any specific feature, but he noted that small details weren't overlooked simply because they were making a huge world. Hasn't personally finished the game yet, and confirms the existence of vehicles. Asked about his time during the boy scouts. Talks about the thrill of hiking and climbing, only to find new distractions. Link finds a raft, and uses a Korok leaf to blow some wind through the sail. He crosses the river, before disembarking and running alongside the stream to a bridge. The raft floats along and meets him there!</p><p>The game has a temperature system. The higher you climb, the colder it gets. You need to prepare with proper clothes, and eating the right food. Last thoughts from Miyamoto; there was a lot of back and forth with the developers regarding items, and how detailed the game should be.</p><p><b></p><p><b>Segment Eight: More Shrines</b></p><p>Outside the woodcutter's cabin. Who's the woodcutter? I must know! Link gets a pot lid, which can be used as a shield. Yes. Another Korok appears! Link gets an axe and fells a tree, forming a bridge across a gap. Climbs a cliff but has to find a place to rest. Finds a truffle and a 'rushroom'.&nbsp;</p><p>Shrine 'Owa Daim'. Stasis Trial. Link gets the Stasis ability, which lets him freeze certain objects. Stops spinning platforms and boulders. It doesn't just freeze objects, but can make them fly from stored kinetic energy after being struck repeatedly.</p><p><b></p><p><b>Segment Nine: Hunting and Gathering</b></p><p>Link is at a camp, and shoots a pheasant. If only it was Falco. He kills a boar next, and grabs some juicy steaks, before nabbing some truffles. He then gets a butterfly. And a Hylian Shroom. There's so much! Food has specific benefits, which can be drawn out during cooking. Hunting isn't necessary. You can even do a 'veggie' playthrough, and cook vegetarian dishes. Nice!</p><p>Insects can be found by cutting grass, and frogs are also not safe from your insatiable hunger.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Cooking is shown. You can eat a raw steak for one heart, or cook it for more benefits. You can then further refine the recipe (Link makes a steak skewer). He then drops the truffles in the pot, and makes a meal. After that, he cooks crickets, and makes an elixir. Dishes can improve things like offense, defense, stealth, and stamina. The player makes note that he always carries a portable fire-starting kit.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Absolutely love the freedom on offer here.You can do bomb fishing! Again, fish availability depends on the time of day. You can also fish using spears and arrows.You need stamina to swim. Interesting.Time to make something gross. Mushroom, Nightwing and Butterfly makes... a spicy elixir! Whoops, it worked. They try again with a fish, butterfly and acorn, and end up with a 'dubious food' .Link runs around, before a huge rock monster appears out of nowhere, completely unplanned. A 'Steppe Talus', Link immediately goes to town on it. Before dying in one hit. This ain't your Daddy's Zelda.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">At night, the temperature drops, so camp fires are very useful. Link comes across a Bokoblin camp, as a wayward boar enters the fray. The enemies run off to chase it. What a nice touch.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Segment Ten: Another Shrine</b></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Link cooks up peppers to help him with the next snowy area. I can't hear it, but he apparently hums when getting his chef on! Laying down some flint and wood, a fire can be started when striking them with a blade. Damn! You can light treasure chests on fire. Wut.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">His skin actually gets red with the cold. That detail! Link climbs the Great Plateau, and meets the same old man, who gives him a quilted shirt as a reward.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Shrine 'Ke Numut'. Link gets the Cryonis Rune, which makes ice pillars from water. He can climb them, and use them to lift things.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Segment Eleven: Eiji Aonuma</b></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Ooooh, we're now heading outside the demo area. Aonuma is asked about the challenges in making the world. He says verticality was important in its design, so that Link could see faraway things that would make the player interested in checking out. Apparently today's Plateau showing is less than 2% of the game. No. Way. Aonuma says it was important to add landmarks from old versions of Hyrule. No towns or NPCs are shown at E3, but they are in the game. He's asked about the difficulty of... well, game difficulty in such an open game. He says that getting lost in this game isn't inherently bad like in previous Zelda games. Getting lost off a linear story path is frustrating, but it is more fun in a game that encourages exploration.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">On the challenge of creating the AI: He talks about Bokoblins on screen, and says that they're considered lower tier enemies, but giving them personalities and mannerisms makes them more fun to interact with, regardless of how dumb they are. They also researched animal behaviour.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Asked if he hikes with Miyamoto. Not too many people who would like to hike with their bosses, but he did climb a lot of mountains as a kid. He's a city boy at heart, though.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">A video is played of stuff you can encounter in the world. Mine. Now.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Segment Twelve: More Shrines</b></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">These are two non-E3 shrines. Link enters a giant hamster wheel (basically), and has to make his way to the top. Looks fun! “If I don't like it, I just remove it.” Instead of dealing with the bothersome spiky metal balls, the player simply uses the magnet to pick them up, herds them out the wheel entrance and throws them off the cliff – another highlight of the open-ended design. Cogs... rotating platforms... I'm in heaven. Completed shrines act as warp points in Hyrule. Next one. Trial of Power. Physics are in the spotlight here, with plenty of ball bashing, floor flipping and pinball action. Damn this looks awesome.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Finally, Day One of Treehouse comes to a close. Holy geez. Thanks so much for reading, and I'll see you tomorrow!</span></p></p>
