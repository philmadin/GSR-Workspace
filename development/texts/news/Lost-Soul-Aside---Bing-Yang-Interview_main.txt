<p align="center"><i>In recent days, a videogame called </i>Lost Soul Aside<i> has been making waves on the internet. An action-adventure that looks to be a hybrid of </i>Final Fantasy<i> and hack n' slashers, this incredibly impressive title is all the more amazing considering that it is currently being made by one man - the properly talented Bing Yang. Getting in touch with GSR, I briefly had a chat with the game's creator!</i><br></p><p><br></p><b>First of all, thanks so much for choosing to talk with GSR! To start with, could you tell us a bit about yourself?</b><br><br><br>Thank you for interviewing me.You know my name, and I'm Chinese, and living in Korea now. As you can see, I'm a 3D artist who loves <i>Final Fantasy</i> and action games like <i>Ninja Gaiden</i> and <i>Devil May Cry</i>.<br><br><br><b>So, what made you decide to create Lost Soul Aside?</b><br><br><br>My childhood dream, and the trailer of <i>FFXV</i> gave me the motivation.<br><br><br><b>Interesting, so, when Square-Enix unveiled <i>Final Fantasy XV</i>, you were inspired so much by it, that you decided to pursue your dream? What kind of experience did you have in making games, when you decided to do this?</b><br><br><br>Yeah, the trailer of <i>FFXV</i> looks amazing, and another reason is at that time Unreal Engine 4 came out, which allowed an artist like me to make a game without coding.<br><br><br>I came into the game industry when I was 21 years old, but actually I really knew nothing except the art part before I began to make LSA, and I have to say that I had to learn a lot more in order to get the quality better. Another thing I learned was the process of development after I started the project.<br><br><br><b>Wow, so Unreal Engine 4 allowed you to realise your dream,despite really having no programming skills. That's amazing. Could you briefly explain what<i> LSA</i> is about. Plot details?</b><br><br><br>Yeah, that's the power of blueprint in UE4. Briefly, <i>LSA</i> is about the adventure of a man who has lost his family and happiness, and then wants to seek himself after he meets the monster Arena. The secrets of the unknown monsters and how his family dies will be made clear in the journey.<br><br><br><b>I noticed your partner Arena looks like a Chinese dragon. Were you inspired by Chinese or Korean culture?</b><br><br><br>Yeah, I love Eastern culture as I am Chinese. Arena's design indeed came from the Chinese dragon. I hope to add more Asian elements in the future.<br><br><b><br>That sounds cool! I'd love to see more Asian mythology in videogames. Just a few more questions, and I'll let you go. How big are you planning to make the game? Will it be huge like <i>Final Fantasy</i>? Or something smaller, like <i>Devil May Cry</i> and <i>Ninja Gaiden</i>?</b><br><br><br>Thank you. Sorry, but I'm still working on the plan. I don't think a huge world like <i>Final Fantasy</i> is viable for me, at least for now. I don't want to build a huge world with no details. In the video, you can see the difference between the big grassland and other scenes. It's just too hard to arrange. So, I have to say <i>FFXV</i> really did a great job on the huge world.<b><br><br><br>I agree! It does look fantastic. Regarding the battle system, how deep will it be? I imagine it's something that's very hard to program! Have you been getting any help on this game?</b><br><br><br>Blueprint is a great tool, but indeed it took me a lot of time to get on it, as I'm an artist. I'm kind of self-closing, so I didn't come to others before I had to admit I couldn't do it myself. Luckily, there ae so many documents to refer to, and so many kind guys put their tutorials on the forum and YouTube. And surely I did post on the forum for help.<br><br><br><b>Wow, it kinda makes me want to create my own game now! Okay, I know you're busy, so this will be the last question. When do you expect - roughly - to have <i>Last Soul Aside</i> complete? How far is it in development?</b><br><br><br>Sorry, but I can't promise a release date now. It really depends on how many people I will work with. Fortunately, there were many people who came to me to help with the development; but first of all I have to make a plan. These people are so kind, so I can't ruin their efforts. So when that plan is ready, maybe then I can give out a release date.<br><br><br><b>Okay then, thanks so much for taking the time to answer my questions! I really appreciate it! The game really does look fantastic, and I can't wait to eventually play it. Again thanks.</b><br><br><br>Yeah, you are welcome.<br><br><br><br>You can follow Bing Yang's progress on <i>Lost Soul Aside</i> at these links:<b><br><br><a href="https://forums.unrealengine.com/showthread.php?118030-Lost-Soul-Aside-a-fantasy-action-game "></a><span style="color: rgb(61, 133, 198);"><a style="color: rgb(61, 133, 198);" href="https://www.facebook.com/yagnbing">Bing Yang's Facebook</a></span><span style="color: rgb(61, 133, 198);">&nbsp;</span><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><br><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><a style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" href="https://www.facebook.com/lostsoulaside/"></a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><a style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" href="https://www.facebook.com/lostsoulaside/"></a></span><span style="color: rgb(61, 133, 198);"><span style="color: rgb(61, 133, 198);"><a style="color: rgb(61, 133, 198);" href="https://www.facebook.com/lostsoulaside/"><span style="color: rgb(61, 133, 198);">Lost Soul Aside Facebook</span></a></span><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><br><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><a style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" href="https://twitter.com/yagnbing">Bing Yang's Twitter</a><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><br><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><a style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" href="https://tybercore.bandcamp.com/music">Tybercore - the music behind Lost Soul Aside</a></span></b><br><style type="text/css"></style><br><p><br></p><p><br></p>
