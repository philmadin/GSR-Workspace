<p>Ubisoft finally arrived at the 2016 E3 press conference; expectations included&nbsp;<i>Ghost Recon: Wildlands</i>, <i>For Honor</i>, <i>Watch Dogs 2</i>, and some insight into the future of the <i>Assassin's Creed</i> franchise. So how did they do?</p><p><br></p><p><b>Just Dance 2017</b></p><p>The conference started with a bang with a colourful crew of dancers on stage advertising next year's edition of <i>Just Dance</i> to the tune of Don't Stop Me Now. Gladly, not much time was spent on J<i>ust Dance 2017</i>, which left more time to focus on the more anticipated games this coming year.&nbsp;</p><p>A short and respectful tribute was paid to the victims of the recent Orlando shooting, and then the conference moved on.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Wildlands</b></p><p>Hooray! Some long anticipated gameplay was shown of last year's surprise reveal, <i>Ghost Recon: Wildlands</i>. It's nothing we haven't seen before, especially with the release of two Tom Clancy games since the last conference, but it still looks great. Also shown was an exciting cinematic trailer that revealed more about the game's story.</p><p><br></p><p><b>South Park: The Fractured But Whole</b></p><p>The South Park segment of the conference started with an amusing teaser which was both an homage to games like <i>The Division</i>, and a bait and switch to take viewers by surprise. They went on to introduce the creators, who talked us through several videos introducing the story and the gameplay.</p><p>For those of us who never played <i>The Stick Of Truth</i>, there's good news and bad news. The good news is that pre-ordering <i>South Park: The Fractured But Whole</i> will get you a copy of <i>The</i>&nbsp;<i>Stick Of Truth</i> to hold you over until release. The bad news is that the developers at Ubisoft's conference spent a long time trying to excite people about the fact that characters can now move in combat situations in the new game.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps this is exciting for fans of the original, but it concerns me that so much time was spent on these relatively simple mechanics. However, the superhero idea looks like fun, and South Park games are more about the storytelling anyway which is bound to impress.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Tom Clancy's The Division Expansions</b></p><p><i>The Division: Underground</i> expansion pack received a release date and a trailer (although the latter was thanks to the Microsoft conference), and a trailer was shown for <i>Survival</i>, the second of three previously announced expansion packs. Ubisoft also announced that in celebration of the studio's 30th anniversary, they were adding three new outfits to <i>The Division</i> based on other Tom Clancy games - <i>Ghost Recon</i>, <i>Rainbow Six</i>, and <i>Splinter Cell</i>.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Eagle Flight</b></p><p>Ubisoft has been working alongside Oculus to bring a new VR game, <i>Eagle Flight</i>. The live PvP showed a capture the flag style gamemode in which players fly around attempting to maintain control of the rabbit while shooting at each other. It was a good demonstration of this odd game that looks like a lot of fun.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Star Trek: Bridge Crew</b></p><p>Have you ever played <i>Artemis</i>? It's a ship bridge simulator in which different players adopt different roles to pilot a starship. It is often cited as the game that launched this genre which Ubisoft has now jumped on with <i>Star Trek: Bridge Crew</i>. Actors and actresses from Star Trek were brought on board to play this VR bridge simulator which allows players to play in a shared VR environment on the bridge of the Starship Enterprise.</p><p><br></p><p><b>For Honor</b></p><p>A new trailer for Ubisoft's new IP, <i>For Honor</i>, was released, as well as some gameplay footage from the Viking campaign. After a year of almost no information, this was very welcome, but it seems to have changed direction slightly since the original announcement at E3 2015. The game seems more focussed on RPG elements than previous, as last year's trailer showed mostly combat.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Grow Up</b></p><p>While no-one might be anticipating a sequel to <i>Grow Home</i>, Ubisoft Reflection's experimental game, it's here and it's got some footage that looks somewhat interesting. <i>Grow Up</i> releases in August on PC, PS4, and Xbox One.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Trials Of The Blood Dragon</b></p><p>Speaking of things no-one was waiting for, Trials has a new entry in their franchise! While it's good to see a new release that isn't DLC, <i>Trials Of The Blood Dragon</i> seems like a copy-paste of the established style and action of <i>Far Cry 3</i>'s expansion pack. The trailer showed a snippet of running and gunning gameplay, which might mean a change from the traditionally motorcycling only gameplay. Will it be a welcome or unwelcome change? Decide for yourself. It's available now on PC, PS4, and Xbox One.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Assassin's Creed Movie</b></p><p>After the producer of the new movie came out to say nothing of interest, a new trailer played. This trailer showed some interviews with cast members as well as a lot of very exciting new footage. <i>Assassin's Creed</i> comes out on the 21st of December this year.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Watch Dogs 2</b></p><p></p><p>The moment has arrived! Dedsec hacks into the Ubisoft conference with a new gameplay trailer and a cinematic trailer. If you're interested in <i>Watch Dogs 2</i>, I highly recommending watching these, and watching the half hour livestream from the other day.</p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><b>Steep</b></span></p><p><font color="#0000ff">An open world extreme winter sports game? Ubisoft's newest IP <i>Steep</i> looks like a fascinating idea, and appears from the trailer to involve snowboarding, skiing, parachuting, and&nbsp;</font>wing-suiting<font color="#0000ff">. It will feature&nbsp;multiplayer, and probably a story mode. A second video&nbsp;</font>focused<font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;on gameplay shows that it will highlight&nbsp;challenges such as races, and will allow people to create challenges and watch replays (using what I must say is the greatest replay tool I've ever seen). <i>Steep</i> ships in December and you can register for a beta at steepgame.com.</font></p>
