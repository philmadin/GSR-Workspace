<b>Segment One: Pokemon Sun &amp; MoonTreehouse&nbsp;</b><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">D</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">ay One begins with a look at Pokemon Sun &amp; Moon.With a couple of the game's directors, we get a new look at the Hawaii-inspired location, Alola. A series of islands where the art of Pokemon battle is ingrained within their very culture.Three new Pokemon are revealed: bug type Grubbin, the woodpecker Pikipek and "loitering" mongoose Yungoos. Love 'em!Visuals and gameplay has seen major overhauls. Character models are to scale, which really show-off the designs of the Pokemon. Also, full analogue movement! We are truly living in the future.Battle Royal is revealed. A simultaneous four-way battle hosted online, this looks like total anarchy – in a good way.Developers mention their trip to Hawaii for 'research purposes'. Sure.Game is looking great so far.&nbsp;</span></p><p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Segment Two: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Introduction</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">It's time!!!Link awakens in a chamber. Very ICO. A female voice guides him toward the 'Sheikah Slate', a technologically advanced tablet. Aonuma talks about the technological focus of this new Zelda game.The stamina meter returns, and Link can jump!He finds some clothes, and exits the chamber. Aonuma says you can play the game naked if you want!Holy. Crap.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Much like the very first Zelda, this will have complete and total freedom. Go anywhere. Do anything.Link sees an old man (who has suspiciously Gerudo-like features), and he's directed toward a dilapidated temple. He also mentions that Hyrule is in some sort of dying state...&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Absolutely amazing. Link can interact with practically anything. He grabs some mushrooms and apples (that can be eaten for health) and sets fire to some bushes, showing some of the dynamic features of the engine. He grabs an axe and chops down a tree for firewood.Another huge feature is his ability to climb. What look like impassable rock-faces are quickly scaled.He then takes a dip into a pond, where he meets a Korok! Wind Waker timeline, perhaps?Near the temple, he fights some Bokoblins, and takes their weapons to use against them! Apparently weapons will break, so you need to keep a healthy stock.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">We also get a look at the new physics system, with rag-dolling and bouncy stuff everywhere. Link also has a new flurry attack, which makes him go all Goku by striking at a blinding rate while time is stopped.Food needs to be eaten to regain health. No more hearts. Everything I've known has been a lie.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Time's Up! Someone done goofed, and forgot to disable the demo restrictions.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Time to start again...&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">We're back, and Link has no pants.Survival seems to be the big theme for this Zelda game. You start with nothing, and have to scrape and claw your way to a slick arsenal. Hunting. Gathering. It's all in your hands. The game offers total freedom, and you can play any way you want. Go anywhere. Do anything. The world is basically one huge (and I mean huge) sandbox.Graphics are absolutely stunning. It's unbelievable that this is running on Wii U, and it makes me shiver to think what Nintendo will be able to do with the NX.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Segment Three: Exploration</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Time to sate some wanderlust. The Treehouse player aims to climb the highest mountain in the region, and she highlights many new things.The first thing is your Sheikah Slate, which can set waypoints (as you probably remember from older footage), and scan enemies to reveal their HP. He then uses the sailcloth to glide, which looks incredibly fun. Also new are bombs, which glow blue, and are now detonated remotely. There are two types; spherical ones made for rolling, and cubes made for planting.Enemies and wildlife behaviour changes depending on the time of day.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Link enters a snowy area, and shivers. Aww, bless his slowly-failing heart!LINK CAN USE HIS SHIELD AS A SNOWBOARDLINK CAN USE A SEVERED STALFOS ARM AS A WEAPON, WHILST ITS STILL TWITCHING! &nbsp;Intriguingly, items like fire arrows are simply found in random chests, with no fanfare to speak of. Jesus, what haven't they changed in this game?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Segment Four: Shrines</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">We now come to shrines. These are basically mini dungeons, and there are over a hundred of them. They focus on puzzles, combat or getting new items.The first shrine ('Oman Au') we see is based on a trial called 'Magnesis', which is a (you guessed it) upgrade based on magnetic pull. These upgrades are called 'runes', and are basically downloaded to your Slate. Each rune essentially replaces the tools from previous Zeldas.Awesome look at the new physics engine.Apparently each shrine is named after the monk who you meet at the end. Each monk will give you a spirit orb, though their use is unknown.Of course, rune can be used outside, and we see Magnesis being used to pull up treasures and metal junk from a pond. You can even use a giant objects as wrecking balls – and if you're so inclined, could take them with you throughout your adventure. Dat freedom!&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Next shrine, called Ja Baij – the Bomb Trial.We witness the new cube bomb, which is good for planting.You can open chests from behind. I can't take this any more. The change! It hurts!!!&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Segment Five: Combat</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">We see more of the weapons and combat in action.Link picks up a big two-handed sword.Some foods give you buffs (extra temporary health).&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Stealth; Link hides in the grass, and there's a sound meter.Different enemies and wildlife depending on time of day.Insect gathering.Spear used. Fast thrusts.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Link approaches a Skull-shaped fort. Blows them all to hell with explosive arrows and barrels.Link now wields a pitchfork!Link goes all Neo and shoots a couple of bokoblins whilst paused in the air.Guardian fight. You can throw weapons for a critical hit! You can then pick them up using your magnet and swing it for more damage!&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Segment Six: Amiibo</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Bill Trinen talks about Wolf Link Amiibo. Scans it in the new Zelda, bringing Wolf Link into the game as a partner!!!Wolf Link helps with combat, and will sniff out treasures. He will even hunt animals for you!Link picks up some radishes and acorns, as Mr. Wolf kills a wildbeast.Bill talks about Amiibo creation. Models start out as 3D printed from in-game assets, before being refined, test-painted. From start to finish, an Amiibo can take 10 to 12 months to make.The duo are now hunting a boar.Wolf Link's hearts from Twilight Princess will carry over. If he dies, he exits the game. If you want to use him again, you need to wait 24 hours before scanning again.If you get separated, you can whistle to call him.More Amiibo! New Link figures,; Archer Link, Rider Link and a new Guardian Amiibo! The latter will be the first Amiibo to have opposable parts (bendy legs).Continued in Part Two...</span></p></p>
