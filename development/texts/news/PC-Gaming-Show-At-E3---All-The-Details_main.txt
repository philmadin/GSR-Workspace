<p>AMD and PC Gamer’s E3 presentation, the PC Gaming Show, is not as well-known as the other shows at E3. Since its’ debut last year, it’s been a good chance for developers to show a wide variety of PC games coming out over the next year or two in a much simpler and more casual format. This year, the show ran for just under three hours, and they get through content a lot quicker than the press conferences. Hold onto your keyboards, PC gamers. This will be a long one.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Dawn Of War 3</b></p><p>The first game of the show is a first look at <i>Dawn Of War 3</i> gameplay. More impressive is the man in the giant space marine suit who stood on stage through the entire segment. A few abilities were announced, including a giant laser from space which can be moved around the map like a unit. I don’t know a whole lot about <i>Dawn Of War</i>, but any game which features giant lasers from space has my interest. Some more gameplay footage will be played on Twitch on June 24. <b><i>Dawn Of War 3 </i>will be available on PC in 2017.</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Oxygen Not Included</b></p><p>Anyone who has read our <i>Mark Of The Ninja</i> <a href="http://gamesharkreviews.com/review.php?t=Mark_Of_The_Ninja_Review&amp;g=Mark_Of_The_Ninja">review</a>, and noticed that the article you’re currently reading was written by&nbsp;the same person, would know how excited I got about our next title from <i>Ninja </i>developers Klei Entertainment. <i>Oxygen Not Included </i>is a colony simulation game which we didn’t get to see much of, but the three second shot that was shown suggests that it’s going to be funny and it could get ridiculous.<i> <b>Oxygen Not Included</b></i><b>&nbsp;arrives on PC later this year.</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>ARK: Survival Evolved</b></p><p>In a world saturated with expansion packs, DLC, and timed exclusives, the next <i>ARK</i>-related announcement feels like a breath of fresh air after everything else at E3. Some of the developers from <i>ARK: Survival Evolved </i>appeared to announce some new content:</p><ul><li>the Redwood Biome, a beautiful area with new resources, rivers, and trees where players can build treetop bases;</li><li>the Titanosaur, which is the biggest dinosaur in ARK, and cannot be tamed in normal ways, but fortresses can be built on their backs;</li><li>Primitive Plus, which is a mod that has become official and adds hundreds of custom objects and weapons to the primitive gameplay;</li><li>Primal Survival, another mod gone official which makes any animal playable and includes life cycles, mating, packs, hunting, and poo-flinging as monkeys.</li></ul><p><b><i>ARK: Survival Evolved</i> is available in Early Access now and new content as well as PS4 and Xbox One versions of the game will be available soon.</b></p><p><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p><p><b>Giant Cop</b></p><p>In one of the more interesting VR concepts for a while, <i>Giant Cop</i>, players will be able to become a, well, a giant cop. This might involve flinging tiny people into the ocean, throwing exploding gas tanks at protesters, or using security cameras to find criminals and dealing with them in a way only a giant cop could. <b><i>Giant Cop</i> will come to PC for Oculus Touch and later HTC Vive this year.</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord</b></p><p>A cinematic trailer for <i>Mount &amp; Blade 2</i> suggests that this feudal simulation sandbox will feature more complicated medieval machinery. More details confirmed this, but also explained that siege can be played in single or multiplayer, different attack routes can be chosen, and that (at least in single player) sieges could involve up to 500 fighters. <b><i>Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord</i> will crash down the door and ride onto PC later this year.</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>The Surge</b></p><p>Is… is that a guy in a mech suit fighting other guys in mech suits? I haven’t heard much about this game from the developers of <i>Lords Of The Fallen</i>, but the very brief cinematic trailer as well as some gameplay footage I found online suggests that it involves fighting through levels with ridiculous punches and swords that can remove limbs or slice people in half. <b><i>The Surge</i> will release in 2017 on PC.</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Lawbreakers (formerly Project BlueStreak)</b></p><p><i>Lawbreakers</i>, a low-gravity fighting game shows people flying around using jumps, grapples, and guns to get around while destroying their opponents. It seems like a class-based FPS, such as Team Fortress 2 or Overwatch, which will pit Law against Breaker. <b><i>Lawbreakers</i> developers aim to have this free-to-play title on Steam Early Access in August.</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>AMD</b></p><p>Three new graphics cards were announced at the PC Gaming Show, but that’s not even the most exciting bit. AMD announced the VR Backpack, which allows certain computers to be worn on one’s back to make cords an issue of the past.</p><p>A trailer for the brand new <i>Serious Sam VR</i> demonstrated the dual GPU system for VR. <b><i>Serious Sam VR: The Last Hope</i> will enter Early Access within the next few months. </b>AMD also announced that they are working on CPUs now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Vampyr</b></p><p>From the makers of <i>Life Is Strange</i> and <i>Remember Me</i> comes a game where you can play as a vampire. That’s all I need to know – when can I preorder?</p><p>A gameplay trailer showed teleportation during swordplay, mysterious powers of all sorts, and a brief look at a dimly lit London. <b>Vampyr will come to Playstation 4, Xbox One, and PC in 2017.</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Killing Floor 2</b></p><p>A new content pack for <i>Killing Floor 2</i> named <i>Bulls-Eye</i> will add more weapons, more ways to kill monsters, and more attacks for the monsters which the player will now be able to play as. A gameplay trailer also showcased new characters and maps. <b><i>Killing Floor 2’s Bulls-Eye content pack is now available on Playstation 4, PC, and Linux. You can play it for free this weekend on Steam, and it will leave Early Access later this year.</i></b></p><p><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p><p><b>Killing Floor Incursion</b></p><p>More from <i>Killing Floor</i> developers and Oculus – <i>Killing Floor Incursion</i>, an entirely new experience for VR.<b><i> Killing Floor Incursion</i> is yet to receive a release schedule.</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Superhot VR</b></p><p><i>Superhot</i> also joins the list of games to be adapted for VR. Knowing the game mechanics behind <i>Superhot</i>, this may prove to be one of the most interesting yet. <b><i>Superhot</i> <i>VR</i> will arrive on PC for Oculus Touch later this year.</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Tyranny</b></p><p>Obsidian Entertainment and Paradox Interactive team up to create an RPG that asks, “What if evil won?”. The fantasy isometric game will give a lot of power to the player to change the world based on their decisions. <b><i>Tyranny </i>is yet to receive a release schedule.</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Observer</b></p><p>As outlandish as a cyberpunk / sci-fi horror sounds, the first shot from the new teaser for <i>Observer</i> shows exactly how and why it works. This is the second game in a row which is described with a question at the show: “what would you do if your fears got hacked and used against you”? The player takes on the role of Dan, a member of the police unit called the Observers. The Observers’ job is to hack people’s minds and memories, which the player does by investigating and scanning the environment. A brief and intriguing gameplay trailer was shown. <b><i>Observer </i>is yet to receive a release schedule.</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Dropzone</b></p><p>Somewhere on the line between RTS and MOBA exists a 15 minute game called <i>Dropzone</i>. The player controls three units and fights one on one with others. <b><i>Dropzone</i> will drop in on PC for free later this year.</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>ARMA 3 Apex</b></p><p>Introducing new vehicles, weapons, a large map, and a 4-player co-op campaign is a huge undertaking. That’s why <i>ARMA 3 </i>developers have spent three years working towards this expansion pack, <i>ARMA 3 Apex</i>. A sneak preview has been released for developers to begin modding. <b><i>ARMA 3 Apex</i> arrives on July 11 for PC, Linux, and Mac.</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>The Turing Test</b></p><p>Shiny new first person puzzle game <i>The Turing Test</i> sounds like it could have an interesting story. It aims to explore the meaning of human intuition and will apparently have a fourth wall breaking narrative set on Europa. Yet with an Energy Manipulation Tool (essentially a gravity gun with a couple of other abilities) behind the main mechanics for the game, and gameplay footage featuring shiny white labs and disembodied robot voices, it’s hard not to compare the game to both Half-Life and Portal. It does look spectacular though, and other reviewers who have tried it seem to have high hopes for it. <b><i>The Turing Test </i>comes to Xbox and PC in August.</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Overland</b></p><p><i>Overland </i>makes no large promises: a road trip across procedurally generated levels in a post-apocalyptic North America, in which players must manage their fuel, weapons, and other resources. The gorgeous artistic style is simple but effective, with minimal warm colour schemes. <b><i>Overland</i> is yet to receive a release schedule, but will release on PC, Linux, and Mac.</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Dual Universe</b></p><p>The combination of a small team with big ambitions and the space exploration gameplay invites strong comparisons to <i>No Man’s Sky</i>, but developers of <i>Dual Universe</i> want players to know that it isn’t. The universe is fully editable (what this specifically means is unclear as of yet), will allow players to rebuild civilisation together, and is very visual different. It’s also an MMO. Ships, space stations, houses, and even entire cities can be built using minerals harvested from the ground, people can play out their own success stories within the game, and communities can co-operate to any end goal of their choosing. <b><i>Dual Universe </i>will enter alpha in early 2017 for PC.</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Halo Wars 2</b></p><p>If you missed <i>Halo Wars 2 </i>at the Microsoft conference, I highly recommend you read about it <a href="gamesharkreviews.com/news.php?t=Microsoft_Press_Conference_at_E3_-_All_The_Details">here</a> as nothing new was announced at this show. <b><i>Halo Wars 2</i> arrives on Windows 10 and Xbox One on February 21.</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Day Of Infamy</b></p><p><i>Day Of Infamy</i> began life as a mod for New World Interactive’s previous title, <i>Insurgency</i>. It’s a role-based squad FPS set during WWII, inspired by Day Of Defeat and featuring a similar level of gritty realism. <b><i>Day Of Infamy </i>enters early access in July on Steam.</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Mirage: Arcane Warfare</b></p><p>From the developers of <i>Chivalry: Modern Warfare</i> comes <i>Chivalry: Modern Warfare </i>with magic. Just as in <i>Chivalry</i>, <i>Mirage</i>’s combat is hugely about paying attention to the other player’s animations to see what they are going to do and attempt to block or counter it. <i>Mirage </i>keeps the swordplay but adds magic, colour, and beautiful environments. <b><i>Mirage: Arcane Warfare </i>arrives on Steam in late 2016.</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Mages Of Mystralia</b></p><p><i>Mages Of Mystralia</i>’s biggest selling point is crafting your own spells. This is done using “runes with magical properties that can be combined into millions of different possibilities” (from the official website). How exactly this will work remains to be seen. But the game is very cute, and reminiscent of Magicka, which means a lot of fun to be had. <b><i>Mages Of Mystralia </i>will magically appear on PC in 2017.</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Warframe</b></p><p>A new game mode for <i>Warframe </i>was announced titled <i>Lunaro</i>, which is being called “<i>Rocket League </i>for<i> Warframe</i>”. Players team up to hit the ball into the goal. Pretty simple. <b><i>Warframe: Lunaro</i> is available now on PC, Xbox One, and Playstation 4.</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Deus Ex: Mankind Divided</b></p><p>And for the final game announcement for this show, some long-awaited gameplay from the first mission of <i>Deus Ex: Mankind Divided </i>arrives. It shows an Adam Jensen much more comfortable with his augmentations, which means much smoother and faster animations / movement. UI can also now be scaled and customized by the player.<b><i> Deus Ex: Mankind Divided</i> releases on August 23 for PC, Xbox One, and Playstation 4.</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Warren Spector on the future of PC Gaming</b></p><p>The creator of the original <i>Deus Ex </i>as well as a developer on <i>Thief: Deadly Shadows </i>and <i>Epic Mickey</i>, Warren Spector, takes to the stage to talk about PC gaming and the industry.
