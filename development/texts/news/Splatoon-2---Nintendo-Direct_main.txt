Salmon Run, a new four-player co-op mode, is coming to <i>Splatoon 2</i>! By teaming up with friends, players can take on a part-time job battling the new Salmonid species, which the Squid Research Lab reports might even be more lethal than the Octarians! When players fall in co-op mode, teammates can revive them by inking them on the battlefield. <i>Splatoon 2</i> launches exclusively for Nintendo Switch on July 21.
