Outside the station, the parking lot contains long sightlines, but once inside, cramped hallways and a computer-cluttered broadcast room provide ample close-range combat opportunities.</span><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Chinatown</b><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">: Set in a foggy downtown district, this nighttime map is lit up by flickering neon signs and a full moon. A re-imagining of the original Call of Duty multiplayer map "Carentan", players will need to be careful on these streets, as almost every building in the map can be occupied, providing perfect cover for enemies waiting for a chance to line you up in their sights.</span><br></p><p><br></p><p></p><p><b>Creek</b><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">: Set in a wide-open village ravaged by combat where concealment is the difference between life and death, a gaping ravine divides this map into two.
