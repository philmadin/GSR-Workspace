<p>Ubisoft have announced that the 5th addition to the Far Cry franchise will release on February 27, 2018. Developed by Ubisoft Montreal, gamers are being taken to America for the first time in Montana where they will fight for survival and freedom.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>As the new junior deputy of fictional Hope County, players find that their arrival accelerates a years-long silent coup by a fanatical doomsday cult, the Project at Eden's Gate, igniting a violent takeover of the county. Caught off guard and drawn into a power struggle, players must disrupt the Project at Eden's Gate's carefully laid plans, and fan the fires of resistance to help liberate the Hope County community and themselves.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Under siege and cut off from the rest of the world, players will join forces with residents of Hope County and form the Resistance. The fight against the cult will take players to unique locations throughout Hope County that will&nbsp;provide different gameplay experiences. While tracking down cult members and gathering resources for survival across farmland, forests, mountains and rivers, players can get behind the wheel of iconic American muscle cars, big rigs, ATVs and boats. Vehicles also provide refuge when under attack by animals or as a way to quickly escape when things don't go as planned.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Players will also be able to fly planes to engage cult forces in aerial dogfights across Big Sky Country.</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>To take down the cult, players will need to utilise any and all weapons at their disposal, including ranged weapons such as guns and grenades and melee weapons like a sledgehammer or baseball bat. Additionally, players can recruit Guns for Hire from a large cast of characters, or even Fangs for Hire -&nbsp;specialised animals like bears and cougars to complement players' playstyles whether they're going in stealthily or forcefully. How players approach each situation and the chaos they create in Far Cry 5 is up to them. Far Cry 5 will also see the return of the map editor, giving players the opportunity to create and play an infinite amount of new playgrounds. The map editor will include new features that add a new dimension to the content created by fans, with more details coming soon.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Players will also have the freedom to navigate this serene but twisted world solo or entirely in two-player co-op. Far Cry 5 will release on PS4, Xbox One (including Scorpio) and PC.</p>
