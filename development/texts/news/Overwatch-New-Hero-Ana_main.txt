The newest hero joining the <i>Overwatch</i> team post-launch will be Ana, a support hero that uses a special sniper rifle to heal allies. Ana was one of the founding members of Overwatch and will use her skills to defend the people she cares for, including Pharah, her daughter. <br><br>Her main weapon, the Biotic Rifle, shoot's darts that can heal allies or damage enemies. Ana also has a sidearm equipped with a sleep dart that will briefly knock an enemy unconscious (unless damaged). Her other source of healing is the Biotic Grenade which has an area of effect that will heal allies. It will boost the amount of healing received for teammates when they stand in it, while damaging and blocking healing for enemies. <br><br>Nano Boost, Ana's ultimate, is a combat boost for allies that makes them move quicker, deal more damage and take less damage. This will help with final pushes or when both team's are stuck in Overtime. <br><br><i>Blizzard</i> have provided an origin story for Ana, including a comic on how she lost her eye. She will be released for free in a later patch.<br><br>Legacy Comic: http://comic.playoverwatch.com/en-us/legacy<br>Origin Story: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzFWIw7wV8Q<br><br><br>
