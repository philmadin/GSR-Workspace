After it was initially refused classification, <i>Outlast 2</i> has now been given the green light to be released in Australia on April 26 with an R18+ rating.<br><br>The initial refusal came after the Classification Board found the game to "depict, express or otherwise deal with matters of sex, drug misuse or addiction, crime, cruelty, violence or revolting or abhorrent phenomena in such a way that they offend against the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults to the extent that they should not be classified."<br><br>It is unknown how the decision was reversed since no alterations were made but Red Barrels has since issued a statement saying "<i>Outlast 2</i> has been rated R18+ by the Classification Branch in Australia and will be released 26th April 2017. There will be only one version of <i>Outlast 2</i> available worldwide."<br><br>Good news for horror fans!<br>
