<pre class="western" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Ubuntu"><font style="font-size: 11pt" size="2"><span style="font-weight: normal">In recent days, a videogame called </span><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Lost Soul Aside</span></i><span style="font-weight: normal"> has been making waves on the Internet. An action-adventure that looks to be a hybrid of </span><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Final Fantasy</span></i><span style="font-weight: normal"> and hack n’ slashers, this incredibly impressive title is all the more amazing considering that it is currently being made by one man – the incredibly talented Bing Yang. Getting in touch with GSR, I briefly had a chat with the game’s creator!</span></font></font><font face="Ubuntu"><font style="font-size: 11pt" size="2"><b>First of all, thanks so much for choosing to talk with GSR! To start with, could you tell us a bit about yourself?</b></font></font><font face="Ubuntu"><font style="font-size: 11pt" size="2">Thank you for interviewing me. You know my name, and I'm Chinese and living in Korea now. As you can see, I'm a 3D artist who loves <i>F</i><i>inal </i><i>F</i><i>antasy</i> and action games like <i>Ninja</i><i>G</i><i>aiden</i> and <i>Devil May Cry</i>.</font></font><font face="Ubuntu"><font style="font-size: 11pt" size="2"><b>So, what made you decide to create <i>Lost Soul Aside</i>?</b></font></font><font face="Ubuntu"><font style="font-size: 11pt" size="2">My childhood dream, and the trailer of <i>FFXV</i> gave me the motivation.</font></font><font face="Ubuntu"><font style="font-size: 11pt" size="2"><b>Interesting. So, when Square-Enix unveiled <i>Final Fantasy XV</i>, you were inspired so much by it, that you decided to pursue your dream? What kind of experience did you have in making games, when you decided to do this?</b></font></font><font face="Ubuntu"><font style="font-size: 11pt" size="2">Yeah, the trailer of <i>FFXV</i> looks amazing, and another reason is at that time Unreal Engine 4 came out, which allowed an artist like me to make a game without coding.</font></font><font face="Ubuntu"><font style="font-size: 11pt" size="2">I came into the game industry when I was 21 years old, but actually I really knew nothing except the art part before I begin to make <i>LSA</i>,and I have to say that I had to learn a lot more in order to get the quality better. Another thing I learnt was the process of development  after I started the project.</font></font></pre><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><br></p><pre class="western" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Ubuntu"><font style="font-size: 11pt" size="2"><b>Wow, so Unreal Engine 4 allowed you to realise your dream, despite really having no programming skills? That is amazing. Could you briefly explain what <i>LSA</i> is about? Plot details?</b></font></font><font face="Ubuntu"><font style="font-size: 11pt" size="2">Yeah that's the power of blueprint in UE4. Briefly <i>LSA </i>is about the adventure of a man who has lost his family and happiness, and then wants to seek himself after he meets the monster Arena. The secrets of the unknown monsters and how his family died will be made clear in the journey.</font></font><font face="Ubuntu"><font style="font-size: 11pt" size="2"><b>I noticed your partner Arena looks like a Chinese dragon. Were you inspired by Chinese or Korean culture?</b></font></font><font face="Ubuntu"><font style="font-size: 11pt" size="2">Yeah, I love Eastern culture as I am Chinese. Arena's design indeed came from the Chinese dragon, I hope to add more Asian elements in the future.</font></font><font face="Ubuntu"><font style="font-size: 11pt" size="2"><b>That sounds cool! I'd love to see more Asian mythology in video games! Just a few more questions, and I'll let you go. How big are you planning to make the game? Will it be huge like <i>Final Fantasy</i>? Or something smaller, like <i>Devil May Cry</i> and <i>Ninja Gaiden</i>?</b></font></font><font face="Ubuntu"><font style="font-size: 11pt" size="2">Thank you. Sorry but I'm still working on the plan. I don't think a huge world like Final Fantasy is viable for me, at least now. I don't want to built a huge world with no details. In the video you can see the difference between the big grassland and the other scenes. It’s just too hard to arrange. So I have to say <i>FFXV</i> really did a great job on the huge world.</font></font><font face="Ubuntu"><font style="font-size: 11pt" size="2"><b>I agree! It looks fantastic. Regarding the battle system, how deep will it be? I imagine it's something that's very hard to program! Have you been getting any help on this game?</b></font></font><font face="Ubuntu"><font style="font-size: 11pt" size="2">Blueprint is a great tool, but indeed it took me a lot of time to get on it as I'm an artist. I'm kind of self closing, so I didn't come to others before I had to admit I couldn’t do it myself. Luckily, there are so many docs to refer, and so many kind guys put their tutorials on the forum and YouTube. And surely I did post on the forum for help.</font></font><font face="Ubuntu"><font style="font-size: 11pt" size="2"><b>Wow, it kinda makes me want to create my own game now! Okay, I know you're busy, so this will be the last question. When do you expect - roughly - to have <i>Last Soul Aside</i> complete? How far is it in development?</b></font></font><font face="Ubuntu"><font style="font-size: 11pt" size="2">Sorry, but I can't promise a release date now, it really depends on how many people I will work with. Fortunately, there were many people who came to me for help with the development; but first of all I have to make a plan. These people are so kind, so I can't ruin their efforts. So when the plan is ready, maybe I can give out the release date.</font></font></pre><pre class="western" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Ubuntu"><font style="font-size: 11pt" size="2"><b>Okay then, thanks so much for taking the time to answer some questions! I really appreciate it! The game really does look fantastic and I can't wait to eventually play it. Again, thanks.<br></font></font></pre><pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 150%"><font face="Ubuntu"><font style="font-size: 11pt" size="2">Yeah, you are welcome.<br><br><br></font></font><font face="Ubuntu"><font style="font-size: 11pt" size="2">You can follow Bing Yang’s progress on <i>Lost Soul Aside</i> at these links:</font></font><font face="Ubuntu"><font style="font-size: 11pt" size="2"><b><br><br>Unreal Forum</b></font></font><font face="Ubuntu"><font style="font-size: 11pt" size="2"><a style="font-size: 11pt" href="https://forums.unrealengine.com/showthread.php?118030-Lost-Soul-Aside-a-fantasy-action-game">: https://forums.unrealengine.com/showthread.php?118030-Lost-Soul-Aside-a-fantasy-action-game</a> <br></font></font><font face="Ubuntu"><font style="font-size: 11pt" size="2"><b><br>Facebook:</b> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/yagnbing" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/yagnbing</a><br><b><br>Facebook Official page: </b><a href="https://www.facebook.com/lostsoulaside/" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/lostsoulaside/</a><br><b><br>Twitter:</b> <a href="https://twitter.com/yagnbing">https://twitter.com/yagnbing</a></font></font><font face="Ubuntu"><font style="font-size: 11pt" size="2"><br><b><br>Music: Tybercore – Empire, Raise The Dead, Vision, Discovery</b><br><a href="https://tybercore.bandcamp.com/music" target="_blank">https://tybercore.bandcamp.com/music</a><br></font></font></pre>
