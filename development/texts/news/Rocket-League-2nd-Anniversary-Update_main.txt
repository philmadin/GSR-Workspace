<p>Celebrating two great years of Rocket League, Psyonix have revealed an Anniversary Update which will be landing on the 5th of July. Featuring a free new arena named 'Champions Field', this update will bring an end to Season 4 of competitive and marks the beginning of Season 5.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>On top of the new arena, players will have access to two new Import Battle-Cars in the 'Animus GP' and 'Centio V17', both available exclusively as drops inside the new Overdrive Crates. There are also new customisation options being introduced on top of the multitude we currently have, such as 'Engine Audio', 'Goal Explosions' and 'Trails' - these will be mixed between free selections and crate drops.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>New achievements and trophies are coming, and to top it all off we are seeing the introduction of 'Rocket League Radio' which adds 18 new songs from Monstercat to the game.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Since the games launch in 2015, the community has grown to more than 31 million players with a combined game count in excess of 1.45 billion matches across all platforms. It's great seeing a developer that continues to look after their players, especially with free content. Rocket League certainly isn't slowing down anytime soon, and now would be as good a time as any to jump in if you haven't already.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Rocket League is available on PC, Xbox One, PS4, macOS and Linux.</p>
