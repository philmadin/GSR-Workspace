In the latest video for the soon to be released <i>Prey</i>, Bethesda shows off a unique device for the game called the Recycler Charge. The game allows for your character to recycle almost everything once it is broken down into parts. Then, from these parts, you are able to make new items like armour, medication and so forth.<br><br>How the Recycler Charge comes into play is that it is able to both clear a room and create new items in one use. The downside is that it can destroy something useful or even kill you by accident since it is a prototype device. Be creative and you may find something unique while aboard the space station.<br><br>Prey is set to be released May 5, 2017, on Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC.<br>
