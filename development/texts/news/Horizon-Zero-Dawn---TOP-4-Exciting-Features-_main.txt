<p></p><p></p><p><b>#4 - The World</b></p><p><br></p><p></p><p></p><p>The world of Horizon Zero Dawn looks to be one of the most unique in gaming for quite some</p><p>time. Combining caveman-esque characters and settings with technological advancements such</p><p>as mechanical creatures, creates an interesting dynamic that has the potential to make both the</p><p>story and combat an experience that will be hard to forget. The abandoned civilisations that you</p><p>can discover and explore are also just the icing on top of the cake.</p><p></p><p></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>#3 - Combat</b></p><p><br></p><p></p><p>Rather than being a typical third-person shooter, Horizon takes a more tactical approach to take</p><p>down its varied amount of enemies. There's no spamming the attack button here, but rather using</p><p>strategy to overcome your foes by implementing the many combat mechanics such as traps and</p><p>exposing weak spots that make each encounter feel like you earned your victory.</p><p></p><p></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>#2 - RPG Elements</b></p><p><br></p><p></p><p>The RPG elements of Horizon are what look like the hook that will keep players invested for</p><p>hours on-end. Exploration rewards you as parts you find can be used to craft items that will assist</p><p>you against enemies, dialogue trees help flesh out the characters, gaining information about</p><p>creatures will help you startegise a plan of attack; it's an aspect that hopefully turns this</p><p>Open-World game into something truly special.</p><p></p><p></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>#1 - Original IP</b></p><p><br></p><p></p><p>Okay, we may be cheating a bit here as this isn't technically a feature, but just listen. Creating an</p><p>original IP is risky for any Publisher as there's no dedicated audience that are guaranteed to buy</p><p>their product. Guerrilla Games themselves had a hard time pitching Horizon as it was considered</p><p>'very risky'. But look at the beautiful world that has been created, the interesting enemies, the</p><p>varied weapons; it all stems from this original idea and if successful, will be an example to other</p><p>publishers and developers that having creative freedom to craft unique experiences for the player</p><p>can pay off and we're all the better for it.</p>
