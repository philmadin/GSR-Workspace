The minimalistic audio is expertly crafted to enhance the experience. Sound effects exist only to highlight key events such as a gunshot or the lighting of a cigarette, but that&#039;s it. This allows the soundtrack to take center stage: a smooth, swanky low-key jazz track that really does place you in the game. You will want to play this with the sound on.
