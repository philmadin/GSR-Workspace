The story takes place two years after <i>HR</i>, and follows Adam Jensen in his new position as a member of the Anti Terrorist group known as Task Force 29. This game deals primarily with the aftermath of the final mission in <i>HR</i>, where most of the worlds augmented individuals (Augs) completely lost control and violently attacked everyone around them, including loved ones. This is referred to as "The Incident", and <i>Mankind Divided</i> displays a new world where a mechanical apartheid is taking place.<p><br></p><p>People no longer trust Augs and see them as lesser humans that are potentially dangerous. They are completely shunned from society, often having to sit on allocated benches, different parts of restaurants and even having to ride on Aug specific train carriages. Ques are often separated between 'Naturals' and 'Augs', and while this is shocking, it does have a deep emotional impact when Jensen is consistently picked on for his mechanical appearance. Augs are seen being harassed on the street and are often forced to move into large scale ghettos.</p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><font color="#333333">This rift&nbsp;</font>among<font color="#333333">&nbsp;society is caused by shadowy organisations such as extreme terrorist groups, corrupt governments and the all powerful social elites known as the Illuminati. <i>Mankind Divided</i> offers one of the most complex yet engrossing stories of this year and is greatly complimented by&nbsp;equally enjoyable side quests that coincide with the main missions.&nbsp;</font><br></p>
