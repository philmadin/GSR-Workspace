The music and sound effects simply exist. They never overpower the player, which is a good thing, but they never reach their full potential.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The music is nice, however for the most part is simply background noise. It doesn&#039;t feel intrusive and doesn&#039;t highlight important moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;No one will walk away from playing the game with fond memories of how certain elements sounded; or how interesting or emotional the soundtrack was. Albeit, they certainly serve their purpose well within the game.&lt;/p&gt;
