<br><i>Dragon Quest VII: Fragments of the Forgotten Past</i> is perhaps my favourite game of 2016. It took a long time for English speakers to get their hands on it (even longer for us poor PAL people), but the wait has truly been worth it. Though it can feel old-fashioned in today's videogame marketplace, its charm and sheer playability ensure that those with the patience and desire for classic storytelling are in for a heck of a good time. Absolutely fantastic!<br><br><br><b>Review copy supplied by Nintendo Australia</b><br>
