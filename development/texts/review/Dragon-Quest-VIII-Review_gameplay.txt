&lt;p&gt;Clocking in at about 100 hours all up, &lt;i&gt;DQVIII&lt;/i&gt; is a huge game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite being the first fully-3D title of the series, the game doesn&#039;t play drastically different from its forebears. You still wander the overworld, talking with people and engaging in turn-based combat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there are some new additions. Alchemy plays a big part in obtaining new items and equipment, via combining two disparate ingredients and hoping for the best. Cameron Obscura&#039;s camera quest is a significant new addition, too, requiring you to take snaps of specific scenes and characters, as well as elusive gold slimes. You can even share your pictures via StreetPass!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of that, the game has gone through some very welcome refinements. Like&lt;i&gt; DQVII&lt;/i&gt;, monsters are now visible on the fields, making rare ingredient-scouring much easier. Battles can be sped-up, which is a godsend when grinding, and HP and MP are refilled when gaining a level. Of course, the new portable nature means you can quick save anywhere, too!&lt;/p&gt;
