&lt;p&gt;Gameplay is where &lt;i&gt;Snake Pass &lt;/i&gt;really shines. You&#039;re forced to think like a snake from the get-go and slither your way to the gate at the end of the level. You coil up bamboo ladders to climb, grip things tightly to reach precarious places, and even swim and dive into water. Doodle can also help you out by lifting your tail.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game does a good job of teaching you all the moves in the first couple of levels, however mastering the techniques can be a challenge. You need to learn how to multitask between gripping,&amp;nbsp; moving, and lifting your head up so you don&#039;t accidentally fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The puzzle aspect of this game will have you scratching your head sometimes as you work to figure out how to climb a certain ladder, or how to collect something without falling to your death. It will take you a bit of trial and error before you figure out the answer but, aside from some lost progress each time you die, you&#039;re not punished too badly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of collectibles in each level, such as jewels (for the gate at the end of the level), orbs, and coins. The coins are the hardest to find and reach within the level and the orbs are scattered throughout as something to collect on the way through.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
