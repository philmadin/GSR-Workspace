The audio, when it works, is solid. Unfortunately the voice work, music and even the sound effects cut out on a far to regular basis. When you get to hear it, it is indeed glorious but you don&#039;t get to hear it enough. The music is a standout with differing tracks for each race as well as song inspiring battle music. Voice acting is, as expected, excellent and while the recasting of Gabriel Angelos is painful, the new guy does a decent enough job. The chaplain, inquisitor and Gorgutz, as well as every other Ork, deserve special mention for being the best characters the franchise has to date.
