<br>In all, <i>Yo-Kai Watch 2</i> is an impressive offering from Level-5. Though I don't think <i>Pokemon</i> is in any danger of handing over its throne, the game (well, <i>games</i>) is nevertheless a worthy contender. Packed with a huge amount of content that will last any player a long time, this is most definitely not an inferior knockoff. If you're looking for an alternative to Nintendo's own critter collectathon, then this is highly recommended.<br><br><br><b>Review copy provided by Nintendo Australia</b><br>
