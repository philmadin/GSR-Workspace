&lt;i&gt;Tekken 7&#039;s&lt;/i&gt; soundtrack is a mix of electro and dubstep, which is different to most other fighting game soundtracks. The music mostly fits well with the game, but then again it is a soundtrack for a fighting game, so it&#039;s not going to win any awards anytime soon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I like how every character (for some reason) can understand each other perfectly, throughout my playthrough - it became a bit of a joke to myself how characters can speak Italian and Japanese to each other like they were both speaking the same language. &lt;br&gt;
