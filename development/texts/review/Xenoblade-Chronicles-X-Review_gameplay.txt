<style type="text/css">p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%;</style>Make no mistake, <i>Xenoblade Chronicles X</i> is a huge game.<br><br>Playing very similarly to the first title, you and a party of three traverse the world and engage in semi real-time battles that echo MMOs. Combat is very slick, with streamlined features like automatic healing between battles and a de-emphasis on items in favour of aid via QTE 'Soul Voices'.<br><br>Exploration, too, is superb. Finding special landmarks create warp points for easy travel, and dying in battle simply respawns you to the nearest one - with all experience and items intact. This encourages unabashed adventuring, which is a huge step-up from JRPGs of yore.<br><br>Upon joining BLADE, you choose from one of 10 different jobs - though this doesn't really change much in the way of missions. Regardless, you are tasked with installing data probes throughout Mira in order to expand BLADE's 'Frontier Net', and these will help you generate money, crafting materials, and the special ore called 'Miranium'. this takes a long time to accomplish, and finding treasures in Mira is dependent on the level of your mechanical, biological and archaeological skills (raised with every BLADE level).<br><br>About 50 hours in, you'll eventually obtain a 'Skell'. These are mechs that will open new areas to explore, and will help in battling the worst of <i>Xenoblade's</i> foes. Another 20 hors will net you the power of flight, which really opens the game to its full potential.<br><br>There is so much in this package, I have scant space to talk about it. Passive online multiplayer is also present, which lets you rack up kills with other players in exchange for reward tickets that can be used to buy items, instead of going out and finding them - though this all can be ignored.<br><br>I do have quite a few criticisms, unfortunately. Quite frankly, there are a lot of baffling and lazy design decisions that really bring everything down. Fetch quests are incredibly obnoxious, with vague, useless instructions that had me using Google far more than I wanted. The fact that these make up a majority of the game's content is ridiculous. I also had major issues with levelling-up my crew, which has to be done individually, rather than the way it was done in the first game. Many affinity quests require members to be highly ranked in order to start, and these are incredibly tiring to accomplish. By the time I was done, I was happy to see the end of it all.<br>
