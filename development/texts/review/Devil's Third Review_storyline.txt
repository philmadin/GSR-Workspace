Devil’s Third places you into the rugged boots of Ivan, a Russian terrorist who is serving 850 years in Guantanamo Bay. During his sentence, the US government releases him in order to track down the members of his former squad – the SOD – after they caused a worldwide blackout by detonating the earth’s extrasolar satellites. <br />

Known as the ‘Kessler Syndrome’, the lack of electronics has reverted warfare back to man-on-man combat, primarily with firearms and melee weapons. On top of this, the SOD is spreading a deadly disease called the ‘Chimera Virus’, as well as invading a remote island called BRAAT Island, for its rich deposits of an ultra-rare metal called ‘Rehnium’. It’s all suitably silly stuff, and does its job well. I have to give credit to the writers for coming up with such a diverse range of ideas.<br />
