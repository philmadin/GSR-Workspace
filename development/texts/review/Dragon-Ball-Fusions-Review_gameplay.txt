Dragon Ball Fusions is a turn-based RPG with various action mechanics that try to keep the gameplay fresh. The five on five battles will have you using the environment to your advantage, taking into account your character&#039;s strengths and weaknesses, and constantly swapping out special moves for the stronger, more explosive ones.&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Living up to its namesake, fusions are a major component to the gameplay and often decide the fate of a match. A few hours into the story you&#039;re given the ability to fuse any character you want together, adding a boost of power to your roster. Ever wondered what the combination of&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;Captain Ginyu and&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;The Great Saiyaman would look like? Pick up Dragon Ball Fusions and see for yourself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the combat is initially engaging, but quickly wears thin and becomes stale. The hundreds of available characters are interchangeable with each other stat wise, leaving little incentive to collect them all. Also, the new five-man &#039;Ultra Fusion&#039; completely breaks the game, gifting you unprecedented power while also healing your entire team.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you aren&#039;t in combat, your character can navigate the various worlds throughout the game and complete side-quests to recruit more fighters to your side. Unfortunately, the quests are all basically the same; requiring you to search for a certain someone/something that eventually leads to a boss fight.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
