The moment-to-moment gameplay in <i>Spec Ops: The Line</i> is mostly generic 3<sup>rd</sup> person, cover based shooting. You can change fire modes on certain weapons, give limited commands to your squad, shoot the enemy and revel in the carnage during the slow motion sequences set off during particularly brutal kills. Where <i>Spec Ops</i> shines is in the choices it gives the player, both as story elements and within gameplay. Choices within gameplay seem inconsequential at first, do you leave a wounded soldier to die, put a bulletin him or trigger the scripted execution. The difference is minimal, it comes down to do you want to waste a bullet or not, but as the game progresses further into the dark places that it goes something so simple can be quite challenging. As for story choices I will not spoil them. All I shall say is that all of them have some meaning, even if you donâ€™t realise it at first, and the game is worth playing through more than once to experience the different options. It also happens to feature some of what are hands-down the best cinematic moments of gameplay. From fighting enemies amongst disorienting strobes, to defending convoys, helicopter fights and shootouts against seemingly insurmountable odds, each victory feels earned rather than given, as if you have fought tooth and nail to gain the upper hand.
