From my experience reading about it on Wikipedia and watching that one documentary I found on YouTube, the hammerhead shark has one of the most boring "storylines" (if you can call it that) I've ever had the misfortune to review. The hammerhead is truly a disappointment from the creators given their previous excellence in the shark genre.
