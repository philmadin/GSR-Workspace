<i>Overwatch</i> is what you would define as well executed multiplayer. It knows its audience, it focuses on being accessible, but also open to mastery. The technical aspects are something that should be standard in all games on current hardware and the only issues are mostly theoretical.But without a narrative the game may grow stale if left without follow up content. The gameplay is well executed but that won’t necessarily prevent people from moving on if it’s just the same thing every day.
