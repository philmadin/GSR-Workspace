Whoever came up with this idea is nothing short of a legend. To me, it&#039;s like chocolate and peanut butter. Hot chips and ice-cream. Fish fingers and custard (believe me, it&#039;s awesome). It seems outlandish at first but once you try it you&#039;ll wonder where it&#039;s been all your life. What&#039;s most incredible though is that it still retains the realistic Forza feel - this is not a cheap money-grabbing add-on. You can tell that a lot of love has gone into this to bring many of our childhood dreams alive. If you&#039;re even semi-intrigued by this DLC, trust me, just get it.
