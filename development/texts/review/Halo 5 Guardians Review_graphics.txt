Visually, much like Halo 2, Halo 5 Guardians reaches as high as it can go. Cutscenes mix between stunning pre rendered motion capture and in game visuals. The game itself looks very Halo with a focus on colour and definitive architecture for each race. Players are even able to experience a planet that has been “Glassed” and is in the process of reversing this effect. Something only mentioned in previous content.<br />

Visuals may not be everything, but when they look this good it’s hard to not be impressed. Naturally some texture quality is lost in Competitive Multiplayer and some lowering of the saturation on team colouring would be appreciated.
