You are Captain Martin Walker, leader of a three man delta team who are headed into a Dubai that has been ravaged by sandstorms and civil strife. Your objectives are simple, find the missing 33rd and get out. But, as old friend rear their heads and the pieces fall into place it soon becomes apparent that everything is not as it seems. <i>Spec Ops: The Line</i> begins about as generic as it can get; a team of highly trained, gung-ho operatives are dropped into a desert and shoot nondescript Middle Eastern foes. While initially dull it is soon revealed that there is much more going on than the player knows, the CIA, rebel armies,refugees and eventually the crushing realisation that there is nothing you can do. I will not spoil <i>Spec Ops: The Line</i> for anyone who has not played it but rest assured, it has one of the most compelling and quite possibly the most confronting and mature stories to come out of the military shooter genre, ever.
