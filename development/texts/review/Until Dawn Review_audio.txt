Until Dawn delivers an exciting cinematic experience, as the game creates a spooky atmosphere with rising and falling music; eerie background effects and sudden noise jumps that would leave anyone on edge. Subtleties like these make the game all the better as it also boasts a celebrity cast that turns cheesy lines into believability. Supermassive Games have done a brilliant job of making the player invest emotion in their favourite characters.
