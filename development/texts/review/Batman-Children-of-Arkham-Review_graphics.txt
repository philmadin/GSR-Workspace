<br>Graphics are still the downfall of the series, unfortunately, and many of the 'goons' often look the same. It is good to see that there is noticeable improvement in performance this time around. I didn't experience any frame rate issues which was greatly appreciated. The Penguin as teased earlier also looks much more the part of a true villain. He wears a penguin-like hockey mask with a large beak protruding from it. This modern interpretation is starting to fit a lot better.
