Directly due to its &#039;open-air&#039; gameplay, the story of &lt;i&gt;Breath of the Wild &lt;/i&gt;is the most open-ended since the very first game in 1986.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Zelda&lt;/i&gt; games have never been known for their intricate plots, but this one is especially minimalist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because players can uncover the plot in any way they like, Nintendo has made the choice to not make an overly-complicated jigsaw puzzle. Many fans may dislike this move, but I honestly didn&#039;t have a problem with it. The stories of &lt;i&gt;Zelda&lt;/i&gt; have always been just as much about exploring the world, than it is a scripted sequence of events.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&#039;s not to say there &lt;i&gt;isn&#039;t&lt;/i&gt; any story. Waking from a mysterious 100-year slumber, Link finds the kingdom of Hyrule in a state of desolation, with no memories of what exactly happened. Shortly after, he is told that an apocalyptic evil known as the &#039;Calamity Ganon&#039; has taken residence in Hyrule Castle - and is slowly growing in power.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the most basic explanation, Link needs to destroy Ganon. In fact, the story can be as simple as that. Or it may not. It&#039;s entirely up to you...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
