&lt;i&gt;ME:A&lt;/i&gt; is not a bad video game. But it is a bad &lt;i&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/i&gt; game. If you came in expecting the same quality as the others you will inevitably be disappointed, but if you are a newcomer or just looking for a fun RPG then &lt;i&gt;Andromeda&lt;/i&gt; has enough to satiate you. No doubt in time after many patches and story dlc. &lt;i&gt;Andromeda&lt;/i&gt; will look entirely different; in its current state however it is sadly an intergalactic disappointment.&amp;nbsp;
