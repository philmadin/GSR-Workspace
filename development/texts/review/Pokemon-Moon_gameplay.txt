<i><br>Pokemon Moon</i> disappointed me from the beginning with it's need to hold your hand and direct you to your next destination. The Rotom Dex, while cute, shouldn't tell me where I need to go when a NPC only told me a second before. Exploring is part of the fun with this type of game. Pokemon has never been difficult but there are only so many hints before it starts to become too easy. They need to strike a balance where the beginning tutorials explain the basics without dragging out.<br><br><br><br>What <i>Game Freak</i> has managed to get right, was the ease of shortcuts to remove time spent at the menu screen. Moving Pokemon around and capturing are some of the things that have become quicker due to a simple change. With the removal of HMs, you can now have a well rounded party of Pokemon without sacrificing one for a certain situation. You now rely on island specific Pokemon which will help you travel in any situation. Other cool features are the Pokefinder, a camera for taking photos of wild Pokemon and Pokemon Refresh. A feature where you can play with the Pokemon in your party. There is always something different to keep you occupied in this game.<br>
