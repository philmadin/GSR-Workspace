<br>Coming into this as a newbie, I was initially very confused by what was going on. Fortunately, developers Nihon Falcom were kind enough to include a comprehensive backstory archive, which allowed me to get nicely caught up with everything.<br><br>Basically, <i>Trails of Cold Steel</i> takes place in the Erebonian Empire, as it follows the exploits of 'Class VII'. Part of the Thors Military Academy, it comprises of both nobles and regular folk, and the previous game followed main protagonist Rean Schwarzer and his classmates over the course of a year, as they are sent all over the land to quell terroristic strife.<br><br><i>Trails of Cold Steel II</i> starts immediately after its predecessor's cliffhanger <b>(SPOILERS)</b>, as Rean is whisked away by the 'Ashen Knight' Valimar after the climactic showdown against the traitorous Crow <b>(END SPOILERS)</b>. He finds himself stranded on top of a mountain, with the damaged mech, and a black talking cat named Celine (who is a witch's 'familiar'). Together, the duo make their way to Rean's hometown of Ymir, where he learns that he spent a month in hibernation, whilst his home country has slowly been invaded.<br><br>It's here he decides to find his comrades of Class VII, and where he learns of his destiny as the pilot of the Ashen Knight Valimar, who is the only hope of defeating Crow and his azure mech.<br><br>This is a game that is unafraid to unload details at a rapid rate, with a huge supporting cast and a tonne of lore that is thrown at the player. Despite this, I applaud Nihon Falcom for creating such an ambitious experience, considering the relatively niche place it finds itself in in such a packed, blockbuster-dominated industry. I really enjoyed my time with the story, and though it does suffer from typical anime tropes (one early hot spring scene was very weird and disturbing), I nevertheless found myself gripped by the numerous twists and turns.<br><br>
