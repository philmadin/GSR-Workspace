Put simply, Majora’s Mask 3D has some of the most brilliant – and terrifying – sound design in gaming history. The off-key, Chinese-style warblings of the main theme will penetrate your soul, whilst the foreboding music of Clock Town underlines the sheer desperation the player feels throughout the game. Amazing.
