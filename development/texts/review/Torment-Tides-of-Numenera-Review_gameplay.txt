Torment plays more like an interactive storybook rather than a typical role-playing game. It has an open dialogue-feel for choosing your own adventures. Players can alter their paths and affect the story progression entirely; giving countless possibilities and endings.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combat can feel extremely dull after a while, as it&#039;s turn-based which can become frustrating when faced with enemies one after the other. The interesting part about combat mode is that you have the option to talk to the NPCs you&#039;re in combat with. Not a fan of violence? Talk &#039;em out of it. Bribe &#039;em. Ask &#039;em on a date (just a joke, folks). It&#039;s up to you.&lt;/p&gt;
