The music of Antihero changes from level to level. Every level has a somber yet mischevious feel to it, which automatically makes a person think of something befitting a story of thieves in the Victorian era. Each character has their own voice clips from the gentleman thief &lt;i&gt;Lightfinger &lt;/i&gt;to the cockney Urchin. The music of Antihero is what I believe ties the game altogether as it sets the tone and the gameplay and art style fill in the rest. &lt;br&gt;
