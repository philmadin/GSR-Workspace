&lt;p&gt;Though simple when compared to the lavish campaigns of today&#039;s fighting games, &lt;i&gt;Street Fighter II &lt;/i&gt;was nevertheless innovative for its detailed character backgrounds and ending sequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though greatly expounded upon over the years in extended media (such as &lt;i&gt;Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie&lt;/i&gt;), the plot of the game is very minimalist. Each fighter has their own reasons for fighting, like Ryu wanting to be the best combatant in the world, Guile avenging his friend&#039;s death and Chun-Li investigating the demise of her father - all of which ends with the climactic showdown with M. Bison, the&amp;nbsp;psycho-powered leader of Shadaloo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&#039;d be hard pressed to find a gamer who isn&#039;t familiar with this set-up&lt;/p&gt;
