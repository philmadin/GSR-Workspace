<br>The graphics for <i>Pokemon Moon</i> are great for a 3DS, but the let down is the major frame rate drops and poor optimization. The game takes a while to boot up and close on a 2DS and is only slightly faster on a standard 3DS. It also suffers during battles with more than two enemy Pokemon. The animations sometimes take a while to begin as the 2DS tries to process everything at once. <br><br><br><br>Besides those issues, the environment and character detail is excellent with many unique locations, characters and Pokemon. Most areas feel unique and the art style fits the game, bringing a certain charm to it.<br>
