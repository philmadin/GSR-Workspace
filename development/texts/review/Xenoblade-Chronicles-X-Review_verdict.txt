To sum up, <i>Xenoblade Chronicles X</i> is most definitely an acquired taste. A vast change from the user-friendly Nintendo fare, this is a videogame that requites patience and dedication. It's as hardcore as hardcore gets, and this gave me a love/hate relationship with it. Ultimately, I don't think it's as good as the previous <i>Xenoblade Chronicles</i>, but if you're a JRPG addict, then this is definitely for you.<br>
