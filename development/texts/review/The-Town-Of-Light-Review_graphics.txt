Carefully reconstructed, the asylum which is at the centre of &lt;i&gt;The Town of Light&lt;/i&gt; is brought back to life. It is true to most details and feels both neglected and haunted. Yet, it seems to lack a depth to these details with textures lacking and colours feeling flat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What is truly interesting is the artistic direction that the cut-scenes and diary entries take. The Gothic and somewhat comic book nature of them gives a darker insight into the mental state of &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;Renee&lt;/span&gt;. There is a rawness to them which could almost be believed.&lt;br&gt;
