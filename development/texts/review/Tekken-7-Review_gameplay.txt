Bandai Namco&#039;s decision to release &lt;i&gt;Tekken 7 &lt;/i&gt;to arcades first has paid off. The controls feel smoother than in other installments in the series, and focus has been placed on being able to flow every move and grab together smoothly and efficiently. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Characters feel more balanced, which in turn makes the gameplay easy when you first pick up the game, but the difficulty is ramped up as the player progresses through the game. &lt;i&gt;Tekken 7 &lt;/i&gt;introduces a new Rage Art attack which is activated when the players&#039; health is low and can turn the fight in their favor. As usual with the &lt;i&gt;Tekken&lt;/i&gt; games, the move list has been updated with new moves for every character as well as keeping some fan favorite moves (yay Law&#039;s Somersault Kick!). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tekken 7&lt;/i&gt; has six battle modes to choose from, which include the main campaign and the side stories, offline battles, and local multiplayer as well as the online mode where you can fight players around the world.&lt;br&gt;
