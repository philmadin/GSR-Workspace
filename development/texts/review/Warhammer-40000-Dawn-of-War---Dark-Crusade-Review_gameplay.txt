The minute to minute gameplay of Dark Crusade remains largely the same as its predecessors. However, there are a number of small changes, such as limits to turrets and special units. &amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some new units on offer for each race, each filling specialty roles such as superior Ork-ranged units and better Eldar melee.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;The major changes come in the form of the two new races, these being the Samurai-esque Tau and the mechanical Necrons.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#333333&quot;&gt;The Tau prefer ranged combat and are almost useless in the vehicle and melee department. They have a particularly powerful late game tank and a secondary, internal faction of reptilian birds that specialise in melee. They are somewhat &lt;/font&gt;under-powered&lt;font color=&quot;#333333&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;in the infantry department though some expensive heavy infantry are certainly effective.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#333333&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#333333&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#333333&quot;&gt;The Necrons on the other hand, are a slower race in every way; from build time to movement speed. They have a single building from which all their units are built and, if given enough time, can itself become a powerful weapon. They have a strong focus on drawn out fighting and resurrection&amp;nbsp;which can make for interesting gameplay when paired against faster races such as the Imperial Guard&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
