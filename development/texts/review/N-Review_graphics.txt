<i><br>N++</i> artistic design hasn't drastically changed from it's humble begins in 2004. The little ninja still is a stick figure set within a grey back drop (for the most part) fighting against moving circles and squares hellbent on making you suffer.<br><br><p>The colour used throughout stands out well in contrast to the muted greys and all serve a purpose. As you further progress through the game, colour starts to shine in each level, making episodes more distinct. The beauty of a game like <i>N++</i> is that it doesn't need to be any more than minimalist as it clips along at 60 frames a second and bursts off the screen through it's gameplay.&nbsp;</p>
