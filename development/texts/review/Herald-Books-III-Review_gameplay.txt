&lt;p&gt;Herald is a point-and-click adventure game similar to the Telltale games we&#039;ve come to know and love but does enough to differentiate itself. The excellently written narrative and supporting material are a treat to experience and really help you to dig into the ship and crews past. Conversation happens at YOUR pace (no timer), and there is no clue or indication how your decisions will affect the progression of the narrative. There is also no inventory nor any quick time events, which really helps Herald feel more like a novel than it does a game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, you do a lot of walking through the same areas with little changing. Yes, you&#039;re on a ship with limited space and locations must be travelled through to reach another, but played out it was just a lot of clicking and walking for no real purpose. NPCs that aren&#039;t critical to the quest at the time have nothing of importance to add - and the same objects show the same information each time. If you&#039;re like me and want to click everything on the odd chance you miss something, it can really feel like you&#039;re wasting your time. Stick with it though, each time you reach a crucial stage not only are the conversational options relevant, they satisfy what most of us would want to say in such situations and result in really engaging conversations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a second playthrough, I tested the limits of the game and came up disappointed. Even though the dialogue changes, the conversation direction stayed the same and resulted in the same outcome. I was able to change key events, although I&#039;ll have to wait for the next books to see if I had any significant impact.&lt;/p&gt;
