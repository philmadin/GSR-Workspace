After tragedy strikes the Normandy and her crew, Shepard, awaking two years later atop a medical table, is informed a race known as The Collectors are subjects of The Reapers. With entire colonies of people being abducted to God only knows where, the dubious Cerberus and its leader, The Illusive Man, enlist Shepard to hunt down the Collectors, travel through the Omega 4 Relay and again halt the Reapers' return.The plot itself is actually fairly thin.&nbsp;<p><br></p><p><br></p><p>You have context at key points throughout the game and the pacing is well executed, but the focus isn’t so much on the destination, but the characters on your journey. The Illusive Man sends you out to build your team of Assassins, Convicts, Bounty Hunters and Scientists. These characters each have their own plot lines that can be completed for deeper understanding into who they are as people. The majority of <i>Mass Effect 2’s </i>gameplay takes place on these missions, or doing odd jobs around the galaxy like cleaning out wicked Mercenary hide outs.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>This means your enjoyment of the story will ultimately come down to time invested. Someone who blasts past the characters personal requests will jump through the Omega 4 Relay within only a few hours. Credits will roll, and your team will likely be massacred. Spend the time with your crew and your time played will expand tenfold and leave you with memorable, heartwarming and at times difficult experiences that make you want to keep every single team member alive come the finale.</p>
