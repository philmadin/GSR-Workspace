<p class="MsoNormal">At first the game seemingly only offers a fairly vague premise.  <o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">The initial retro looking menu and chat  screens setting up the actual gameplay initially just seem to be a fairly tacked on pretext, a meta, game-within-a-game style attempt  to enter into the game itself and start shooting as many faceless red men as possible.  <o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">Dig a little deeper though and you will find a bit more substance. It’s hard to give specifics about the story without giving too much away, but a narrative does start to form as you make your way through the game.It’s not The Last Of Us level storytelling, but it works and adds a sinister layer to what could otherwise be a rather bland atmosphere.<o:p></o:p></p>
