Does the game deserve the backlash and social media outrage it received from the fan base? ABSOLUTELY NOT! This game is one of the best call of duty games i have played in years. While fans want only &quot;Boots to the Ground&quot; type gameplay, this game actually serves as a both mechanised and boots to the ground style of game.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would recommend playing this game before jumping on the hate bandwagon because it will surprise you. This game is an action packed ride with a roller-coaster of emotions towards the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If FPS is something you like, you&#039;re in for a treat.&lt;/p&gt;
