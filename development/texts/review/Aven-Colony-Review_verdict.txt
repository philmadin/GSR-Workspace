All up Aven Colony brings a lot to the table that other city builders just don&#039;t. The story and setting of Aven Colony are unique and fun, which goes a long way in keeping players both thinking and engaged in the progression of their colony; as well as coming back to experience the game in all it&#039;s intergalactic glory.&lt;br&gt;
