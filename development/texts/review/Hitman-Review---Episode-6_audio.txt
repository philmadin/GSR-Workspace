Koto and pipe music drifts through the resort areas of GAMA, reminding you that you&#039;re in Japan. But in the hospital areas, a complete lack of music, the mechanical hums of machines, and the occasional beeping of instruments sets the scene well. And over all of it, the artificial voice of KAI is truly believable as an AI running operations throughout both the hospital and the resort. In each area, the scene is set so perfectly and so, dare I say, realistically.
