Though not referred to as such by Nintendo, Star Fox Zero is essentially a reboot/remake of the original SNES and N64 games. If you're familiar with those titles, then you'll be familiar with this.Playing as ace Arwing pilot Fox McCloud, you defend the Lylat System from the maniacal monkey scientist known as Andross. <p>Along with your comrades - Peppy Hare, Slippy Toad and Falco Lombardi – you undertake missions given by General Pepper, whilst working through a campaign that has multiple branching paths.As you'd probably expect, the plot here isn't exactly the deepest, and the decision to go back in time will undoubtedly irk some fans. Honestly, I didn't mind, since reboots seem to be all the rage these days. Either way, I was a big fan of the intentionally cheesy, Thunderbirds-style aesthetic.</p>
