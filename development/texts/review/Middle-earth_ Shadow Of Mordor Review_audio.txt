From the subtle score in the background to the beastly war cries of the Uruk, the soundtrack is as polished as the films themselves. The sound effects flourish by creating an atmosphere that is transparent to the desolate fields of Mordor. The voice acting is also difficult to fault, with great performances all round, but nothing overly notable.
