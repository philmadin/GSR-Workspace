Loading times were frustratingly long, however once the level had been processed, it was a delight to dish up a few corpses. Aside from the nitpicking, the time spent on character details was superb; every orc was as ugly and unique as the last.<br />

Side questing and slaughtering orcs for experience is extremely satisfying. Every fight is different due to the randomised strengths and weaknesses of each captain. Some will run, others will have reinforcements to distract you. Challenges are never far away.<br />
