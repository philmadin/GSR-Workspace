Mark Of The Ninja’s stealth gameplay is something too behold, with many critics calling it some of the best they’d ever seen. Combined with two awesome powers (and one boring one), infinite darts, the ability to walk up walls, and a grappling hook, the maps provide plenty of spaces to explore while still being challenging. Unfortunately, it also makes it too easy to escape from alerted guards, and the penalty makes it hardly worth staying hidden.<br />

There are multiple ways to knock out, kill, or take advantage of guards, and either use, hide, or destroy their bodies. Each rewards the player with a different number of points, which the player can collect to beat high scores and reach point levels (like the classic bronze, silver, and gold trophies), each of which gives the player a point that can be spent on upgrading abilities.<br />

The score system never feels forced, and while the upgrades are a little contrived, the fantastic array of distraction and attack tools available to buy makes it worthwhile. Plus, hanging bodies from lamp posts to scare guards into accidentally shooting each other, and earning points for it, is hours of fun on its’ own.
