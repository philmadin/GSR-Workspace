Starting fresh, players will be loaded into a randomly generated landscape that is teeming with flora and fauna. You have some equipment to get going, but youâ€™ll need to begin working on things like fire and food fairly quickly. A Hunger and Energy Bar slowly deplete as the day wears on till you   must sleep. Sleep provides relief for the next day, but how well you sleep is reflected by certain conditions. Are you too cold? Is the fire still alight during the twilight? How far did you have to walk today? All these things and more determine your recovery for the next day.

Crafting is much more passive and pertains to survivability over sharp spears and personal defence. Bows and arrows, axes, traps, these contribute to collecting food and furs that can then be cooked for food, or fashioned into warm clothing and blankets. An emphasis on working within nature, not dominating it.

There are different locales with varying amounts of resources to draw from. They are referred to as Biomes and can be travelled to provided you have enough food to survive the trip. This is perhaps where my journey ended the most early on. Not having enough supplies to survive the journey will cause you to starve along the way, abruptly ending the play through. It is a tad harsh, as it also wipes your current play through, starting from scratch. If the game where more pressured, it would be welcome as a price for failure.
