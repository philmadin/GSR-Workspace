<p class="MsoNormal">Fallout Shelters is simple and accessible. With ahandful of citizens and a few caps (the in-game currency), you must build roomsthat cater to their needs. Power generators, diners, water treatment plants andliving quarters must be manned by your population to function, and juggling manpowerto ensure you have enough food, water and power can be tough. Throw in thethreat of Rad Roaches, Raider attacks and weirdly common spontaneous fires andyou’ll be very busy early on.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">Sadly that’s where the game peaks.&nbsp; As you unlock more room upgrades and yourvaults population grows the difficulty actually decreases. After you’ve armedeveryone with your surplus of weapons and armor, the fear of outside threats basically vanishes. <o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;After a few hours youwill find yourself with plenty of dwellers milling around doing nothing, andresources and caps aplenty. &nbsp;Andunfortunately there just isn’t enough depth to the leveling up system, or the &nbsp;crafting, to keep drawing you back in.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">The much talked about ability to select who breeds in your vault sounds cool, potentially opening up another avenue to customise your population. And it's interesting, at least initially, but inevitably ends in a creepy, eugenics style breeding program, with the smartest and strongest being locked in the living quarters and pumping out babies non stop.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">There’s no real exploration of the wasteland either, insteadjust the option to equip your citizens with gear and eject them from the vaultin search of caps and better equipment.<o:p></o:p></p>
