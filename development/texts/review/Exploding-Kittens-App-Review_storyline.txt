While this card-game-turned-app doesn't have any form of storyline, it does have a brief explanation as to what each card does in the imaginary battlefield, alongside a cute illustration. For instance, a card that defuses an exploding kitten will say something like "Catnip Sandwich". A card which reverses the order of play might feature a picture of a cat reversing a car. These descriptions and images are always amusing, although the app version of the game doesn't give the player as much time to admire them as the physical game.Â
