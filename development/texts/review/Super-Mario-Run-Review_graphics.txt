Super Mario Run delivers the same vibrancy and charm we&#039;ve come to expect from Mario games. Animations are fluid, and the design hits that sweet spot between retro and modern. Look closer though and you&#039;ll see that the backgrounds are flat and the effects are nothing special. This does not detract from the overall experience.
