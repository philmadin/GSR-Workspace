Despite the soundtrack being somewhat mediocre, it is used cleverly along with layering and effects to create something beautiful that drastically improves gameplay. The foley is inventive and well done, the acoustics changing with the room the player's in is impressive, and the visual representation of the sounds the player makes are simple and effective. The cherry on top of this aural masterpiece is the professional-quality voiceover work which only serves to make the game more immersive and make the characters more real.
