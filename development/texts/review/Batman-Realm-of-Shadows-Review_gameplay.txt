<i>ROS</i> basically handles the same as the last few Telltale Games productions. If you've played <i>The Walking Dead</i> or <i>Game of Thrones</i> you will know what to expect. You have small areas you can explore with a fixed camera and a dialogue wheel that allows you to finally say some badass Batman lines for yourself.<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"> The quick time events are sometimes a bit unresponsive and the explorable areas could use more meaningful interactions. <br><br></span><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">The most substantial addition however is a detective mode similar to the one used in <i style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Arkham Origins</i>. Batman can explore an area and try to piece together a crime scene using his large array of gadgets. This episode isn't really action heavy but fans of 'The World's Greatest Detective' side of Batman are sure to be pleased.Â </span></p>
