The only real changes to the gameplay itself come from your Inquisitors Mark. As the plot progresses you will gain new abilities for your Mark as it gradually becomes more unstable. <br />

Eventually the power reaches a tipping point that requires you to expel energy from it and constantly keep one eye on your focus meter to prevent a devastating overcharge. Whilst not a new concept, it definitely feels very organic, creating its own tension without feeling like a gimmick.<br />

There are new combatants in the Qunari and summoned Spirits, however they are technically just variants on previous enemy types.  The difficulty spikes again much like in the first expansions, Jaws of Hakkon and The Descent. <br />

This time the enemies are more aggressive than defensive. With attentive team management the enemy could be brought down quickly leading to more frantic battles instead of drawn out sponge fights.<br />

The central location for the story, as you have no access to Skyhold upon beginning, is the Winter Palace. Reusing locations is not often enjoyable, however, you spend enough time exploring The Fade and unique destinations connected by the Eluvians that it doesn’t feel too overused. The Winter Palace itself isn’t entirely the same either as you have access to a much wider area than before.
