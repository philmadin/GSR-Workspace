&lt;i&gt;Paladins&lt;/i&gt; is an online team-based shooter. There are a plethora of champions at your disposal and each of them are equipped with a unique set of powers which help them excel at their specific roles.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;, the game has three modes: Siege, Onslaught and Payload. The champions are divided into 4 categories, Frontlines, Support, Damage and Flanks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a 5v5 multiplayer, the game does not lower its skill ceiling but redefines skill. A player with only an accurate aim will always be trumped by a player possessing good team skills and game sense. Knowing when to engage, when to regroup and using your abilities at an opportune moment can be the difference between winning or losing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of diversity among the characters. When you hit the battlefield with any of the 29 champions, no two champions feel alike. Be it the friendly support Pip or the greedy dragon Drogoz, every champion has a different feel to them which makes learning them all the more fun without threatening to be monotonous.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each champion has 4 abilities; these are subject to cooldowns, which is the case for most of the champions. There is also an ultimate ability which does not have a specific cooldown but recharges when you play your champion to its full potential. What sets &lt;i&gt;Paladins&lt;/i&gt; apart is the level of customisation you can have for each champion. You can have various loadouts which perform different tasks. At the start of the match, you have the option of selecting one in three legendary cards which drastically alters your champion. Credits can be obtained during the game which can be spent on buying abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This level of customisation makes &lt;i&gt;Paladins&lt;/i&gt; a very strategic game. Learning to counter your opponents with in-game abilities and choosing specific abilities which help in reducing the enemy champions&#039; effectiveness is crucial. This exposes the game&#039;s biggest flaw - balance. With the champions being unique, some are far better than others and have a relatively lower skill ceiling. As there isn&#039;t a tutorial at the beginning, players find themselves playing the game as any other FPS which inevitably results in a snowballing effect if the enemy is coordinated. The matchmaking system is horrid and often pairs up players with a low win rate against a highly coordinated or a skilled team.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Players with different skill levels being paired up just isn&#039;t fun for anyone and is a catalyst in driving people away from the game. The game also has most of the champions and cards locked. Although they can be unlocked via in game currency, the sparse currency gain doesn&#039;t help the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
