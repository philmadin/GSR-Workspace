&lt;i&gt;Tekken 7 &lt;/i&gt;takes almost everything that made the other games in the series a must have in this genre, and improved on almost all of it. The only downside I saw in &lt;i&gt;Tekken 7&lt;/i&gt; is the lack of depth in the character customization suite; I feel that if you are going to cut back a lot of the customization options from &lt;i&gt;Tekken 6&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Tekken Tag Tournament 2&lt;/i&gt; then at least add in more new features than a VR mode.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All things considered, I like &lt;i&gt;Tekken 7&lt;/i&gt;. The combat is solid and combos are free-flowing and the story ties up the Mishima saga as well as leaving some new questions so that the developer can create more installments to answer in another 20 years. &lt;br&gt;
