<p>The music and sound design present here is simply phenomenal. Mick Gordon has managed to create a perfect fusion of heavy metal guitar riffs and hellish soundscapes that fill you with dread in one second and makes you feel like a complete badass in the next.</p><p>Each and every sound effect feels lovingly crafted and fits perfectly into the tone and theme of the game and the inclusion of some retro sound effects that play upon the discovery of a secret is also a treat.</p><p>I highly recommend you follow his DOOM: Behind the Music series on his YouTube channel and I sincerely hope that the OST for DOOM will become available shortly as I will be listening to it for years to come.</p>
