While the mediocre at best campaign is something of a let down considering the prior title&#039;s claim to having the best campaign ever, &lt;i&gt;Retribution&lt;/i&gt; is still fun enough when played online. The Imperial Guard are interesting enough to bring new life to the game and once you&#039;ve played that you can spend dozens more hours in The Last Stand. It&#039;s value for money and is far from a bad game.
