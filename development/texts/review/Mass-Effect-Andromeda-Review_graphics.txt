The animations in this game are unforgivable in their current state. Any Google or YouTube search of &lt;i&gt;Andromeda&lt;/i&gt; will direct you to articles or videos mocking the game&#039;s character animations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The harsh truth is that this criticism is deserved. The game feels unfinished and not properly tested. Every 30-60 mins you can expect noticeable bugs to break your immersion. From a well-respected developer such as Bioware, this is just not good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
