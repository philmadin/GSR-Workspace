&lt;p&gt;&quot;Conduits&quot; or &quot;Bio-Terrorists&quot; are super-humans who posses various powers. They are imprisoned on an Island called Curdun Cay by the Department of Unified Protection (DUP) to protect humanity from them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delsin Rowe is a small town delinquent whose life turns on its head when a truck carrying Conduits crashes and he gains the powers from one of them while attempting to save him. Aided by his cop brother Reggie, Delsin (now a Conduit), has to choose a path. To become a &#039;Hero&#039; or turn into an embodiment of evil.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delsin travels to Seattle to save his tribe who was tortured for information by Brooke Augustine (also a Conduit), the leader of DUP. The tribe is heading for a painful demise as Augustine impales their bodies with concrete. Delsin must follow clues in order to get to her.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following a series of events which have the same modus operandi, Delsin encounters Fetch and Eugene, two of the three Conduits who escaped in the crash. Now possessing both their powers, Eugene encounters Hank, the last escaped Conduit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trusting Hank, Delsin follows him onto an island and into a trap set by Augustine. Reggie comes to his rescue but is killed by Augustine. Enraged, Delsin levels the Island while battling Augustine. Augustine flees back to her tower in Seattle.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the help of Fetch and Eugene, Delsin overpowers Augustine and either exposes or kills her based on the Karma he possesses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
