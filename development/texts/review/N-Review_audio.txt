<br>Audio is tech inspired which help draw you into the electric neon coloured world. Each song presents a new beat that meshes well with each jump the ninja makes, adding to the tension of a long fall or last second button press. All the enemies have their own distinct buzz and zaps, and the explosions that send you in all different directions are satisfying even if it signals you restarting the level. The audio, much like the rest of the game, is kept within the minimalist art style which helps the overall feel of the game.
