<p class="MsoNormal">The audio works hand in hand with the visuals to immerse you in its Fire Emblem splendour. The sound effects and music are familiar, but in a good way. Heroes is basically a love letter to the games that came before, but has gone just that little extra bit further. The game also features decent voice acting, giving us a greater depth to the characters from the older games in the franchise.Â <o:p></o:p></p>
