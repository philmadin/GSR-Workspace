Building a character that is tailored to you and your abilities as a gamer is what makes Dark Souls so exhilarating. From your fighting class to your shoes, everything plays a role in your success in Lothric. However, taking those skills out into the world is a different story.Combat with enemies can go from exhilarating to frustrating. <p><br></p><p>Unlike its predecessors, Dark Souls 3’s controls feel off, with the camera having a mind of its own. Fighting the games hardest challenges can be foiled by the camera whipping itself into oblivion, and you along with it. With enemies so aggressive, having to fight not only the camera but your characters flippant movement all at the same time is enough to drain the fun away.</p><p><br></p><p>Online gameplay is looking very stable. Cooperating is easier to arrange without Soul Memory, a significant hurdle in Dark Souls 2, for friendly gaming. Invading/Dueling is also simple, with the necessary tools for invasions accessible quite early unlike previously. The biggest aid comes with the Cross Region locks and password systems, first used in <i>Bloodborne</i>. Should you wish to minimise latency, you can block off those outside of a certain planetary radius. Should you wish to join friends directly without interference, set a password and go at it to your hearts desire.</p>
