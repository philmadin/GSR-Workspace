<i>Spec Ops: The Line</i> has little in the way of notable sound effects, at least outside of the characters. It features all the traditional trappings of the shooter, guns go bang, heads go splat, angry men shout and sandstorms block out almost all sound. It’s serviceable. As for the music, its presentation is very unique. Played over the radio by the eponymous Radio Man, it consists of various tracks, each chosen for specific moments, from <i>Bad Boys</i> to <i>Nowhere to Run</i>, they are both exciting and perfectly placed. While the game doesn’t heavily feature an original track, those that are played can be both haunting and epic, dependent on the situation. The voice acting deserves special mention due to how it changes across the course of the game. Captain Walker, voiced of course by Nolan North, it the best example. A seemingly standard thing to hear in a videogame, the voice of Mr North, is slowly twisted until one will never be able to hear it and feel that comfort associated with his voice. It is simply another part of the game that seeks to settle the player before turning the tables in many ways.
