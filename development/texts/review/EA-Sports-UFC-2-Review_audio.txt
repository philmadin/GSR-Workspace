The music and audio features in the game are decent but in no way spectacular. The list of songs you can choose from for your fighters walkout is surprisingly small. There are only a few well known artists with most of the set list comprising of original generic sounding beats created by the developer. Hopefully in the future installments we will be able to see fighters walk out to the songs they do in real life.&nbsp;<p>Other than that the crowd sounds about as you'd expect in a sports game and the grunts and pants of exhausted fighters is accurate enough. The only major stand out is the echoing voice of ring announcer Bruce Buffer who sounds a lot more powerful than in the first game.</p>
