Despite being on current hardware, <i>Homefront: The Revolution</i> canâ€™t seem to avoid graphical hitches. Visual bugs were rare which was good, but the frame rate was very choppy. Even after a patch, switching between <i>Homefront</i> and other games was a difficult process due to the frame rate differences.The visuals themselves are acceptable but many animations for characters are stiff, unless designated specific motion capture.
