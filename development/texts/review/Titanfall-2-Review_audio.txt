The soundtrack of Titanfall 2 is solid. The main theme is catchy and most key moments in the story have an accompanying track that really drives the scene home. The guns sound fantastic, explosions are piercing and the crack of an enemy's neck during a well timed melee is as gritty as it should be.<p><br></p><p><br><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">The one major letdown to the audio is the voice acting in the game. Besides BT-7274, Jack Cooper and perhaps Ash. Most characters sound way too ridiculous to be believable or to create real tension. There are some really bad B movie style quips that are spoken before boss battles and can take the player out of the moment. It won't destroy your experience entirely but it really makes pinnacle moments feel less important due to the terminator impersonator you're about to do battle with.</span><br></p></p>
