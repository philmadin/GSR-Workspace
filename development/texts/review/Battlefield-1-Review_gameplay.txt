This is the most polished and well balanced <i>Battlefield</i> in a long time. Each of the four classes available (assault, medic, support, scout) have their own unique play styles that when implemented properly can swing the momentum of battle in your sides favour. <br><br>Even though multiplayer matches seem to be dominated by assault troopers and snipers there is no one class that is inherently better than the others. <br><br>Each class has their own specific gadgets and weapons exclusive to them, which allow you to help out your team in different ways and that's really what <i>Battlefield 1</i> is all about; teamwork. <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br><br>This is a game that rewards players for focusing on the objective and supporting teammates rather than getting an impressive K/D ratio. It is possible to have 9 kills and 30 deaths and still be in the top 5 of a 30 player team as long as you are playing your class. <br><br></span><p><font color="#333333">The game modes available in <i>Battlefield 1 </i>are reflective of this objective based attitude. Series mainstays such as Conquest, Rush, Domination and Team </font>Deathmatch<font color="#333333">&nbsp;return in all their glory while new modes such as Capture the Pigeon and the incredible Operations make their first appearance. <br></font></p><p><font color="#333333"><br></font></p><p><font color="#333333">Pigeons is a kind of capture the flag esque mode that revolves around the release of friendly pigeons and the execution of &nbsp;the enemies flying rats.</font></p><p><font color="#333333"><br></font></p><p><font color="#333333">If there is one mode every FPS fan should try it is Operations. These huge 40-64 player matches are multi-stage battles that rage across several maps. <br></font></p><p><font color="#333333"><br></font></p><p><font color="#333333">The attacking team is focused on capturing sectors and pushing the enemy back while the defending team is attempting to whittle down the enemy numbers and to hold its ground. This is the mode where the 'Behemoths' come in to play, huge game changing vehicles that wreak havoc on the opposition.</font></p><p><font color="#333333"><br></font></p><p><font color="#333333"> Gigantic blimps, trains&nbsp;and dreadnoughts can sway a battle in minutes. This kind of massive scale warfare is the closest a game has ever come to recreating the events of WW1 as well as creating one of the most enjoyable modes ever in a <i>Battlefield</i> game.</font></p>
