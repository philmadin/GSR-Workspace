&lt;i&gt;Injustice 2&#039;s&lt;/i&gt; soundtrack is mostly generic superhero fighting music. It does the job it&#039;s given, being some nice music that plays in the background, and that&#039;s just fine. Music is not why people buy a fighting game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The thing that sets &lt;i&gt;Injustice 2&lt;/i&gt;&#039;s audio apart is the character voice acting. Each character speaks briefly before each fight; these dialogues can contain hints to past history between the characters, allude to prior events in the overall series, or even be a sneaky reference to Nether Realm&#039;s other series &lt;i&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
