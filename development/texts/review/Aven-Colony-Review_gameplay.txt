Aven Colony&#039;s gameplay is pretty straight forward. You (the Governor), start with a huge open landscape full of all the resources you will need to build a new home on Aven Prime. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As city builders go, Aven Colony is one of the better ones in the genre. The freedom it gives you to craft your perfect home for humanity is second to none, and the story mode will teach you all you need to know, as well as providing a deep story that shows the player the dangers of settling a new planet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
