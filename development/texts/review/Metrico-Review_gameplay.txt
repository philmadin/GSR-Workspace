<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For anyone who lives for numbers, studies graphs, pie charts and all those wonderful (horrible) things, <i>Metrico+</i> may just be your kink. Each puzzle incorporates geometric shapes that alter and shift based on movement. For example, a platform may need to shift from left to right of the chasm ahead of you and to do so, you simply need to walk right across the screen.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The movement however is a little slippery, ironic given a game that focuses on a language of precision. The puzzles are completable without much hassle as there is a perceivable flow to everything you do, not much time is needed to understand and complete a puzzle. In fact the game can be completed fairly swiftly within an afternoon. With only a handful of segments to play through it feels much more akin to a tech/concept demo than that of a game. Despite in fact being a second release to its Playstation Vita original.</span></p>
