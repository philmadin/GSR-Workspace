Movement for Leo is silky smooth as he doesn’t have feet or hands, he simply glides up down left and right as needed. Controls are kept very simple with puzzles mostly making use of your ability to play around and problem solve with small variations, dependent on the environment. For instance, to reach a ledge from the water, Leo must sink down to the bottom, then launch upwards and onto the ledge.<br />

The puzzles aren’t particularly challenging which can be good and bad. Someone looking for the next Super Meat Boy would be wise to keep on searching, but parents will see the benefit in not having a game that causes their child to throw a tantrum.<br />

The game is very short with only five Acts, holding four levels inside each Act. Once your journey with Leo is over, Hardcore mode unlocks, granting you but one life to go as far as you can with. Not a mind blowing addition but trickier than it seems and adds that extra bit of life to the game.
