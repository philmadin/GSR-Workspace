&lt;i&gt;Paladins: Champions of The Realm&#039;s&lt;/i&gt; gameplay is based off the player selecting one of 24 champions spread across four classes; Damage, Flank, Frontline, and Support. Each champion has a set of four abilities ranging from shooting, stealth, bombs, healing, or a deployable shield as well as an ultimate attack, which charges over the course of the match and can be used once per charge. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Paladins: Champions of The Realm&lt;/i&gt; also features a character customization suite which can be used by unlocking items from prize chests, received through gameplay or micro-payments. &lt;i&gt;Paladins: Champions of The Realm&lt;/i&gt; has a unique card system which allows players to craft cards for your favorite champions to give them the edge in battle, such as a buff to shooting or a speed increase. This system gives players the opportunity to mix and match their champion&#039;s abilities in every game to make the most of every map.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I found the gameplay in &lt;i&gt;Paladins&lt;/i&gt; to be pretty much what you expect from a first person, team-based shooter. Every player charges for the objective in the hopes of securing it and throughout the match, you will have to stop the other team from getting their control counter to 100 percent. I liked the gameplay twist the card system introduced and the ability to completely customize your champion to have better attack, defense or elusiveness, it really stopped &lt;i&gt;Paladins: Champions of The Realm&lt;/i&gt; from being just another first-person, team shooter.&lt;br&gt;
