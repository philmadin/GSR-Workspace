Action adventure, role playing, stealth, first person shooter. This game almost defies conventional classification due to the several varying play styles that are offered. It is possible to go the entire game (22 hours +) without killing a single person, on the contrary you can also mow down just about anyone of your choosing. There is so much versatility and <i>Deus Ex</i> encourages creativity. Every level can be tackled in multiple ways and there are often several paths you can take to reach the same objective.&nbsp;<p><br></p><p>Depending on your loadout and augmentations chosen, you may find computers or pocket secretaries that you didn't even know existed. Exploration is encouraged and it is invigorating to gain XP from actually avoiding combat altogether.
