It&#039;s been five years since the last entry in the &lt;u&gt;WipEout&lt;/u&gt; series but this collection of high quality remasters do a fantastic job of reinvigorating our adoration for this classic franchise. This bundle includes remastered versions of both &lt;i&gt;WipEout HD&lt;/i&gt; (including &lt;i&gt;Fury&lt;/i&gt; DLC) and &lt;i&gt;WipEout 2048&lt;/i&gt;.
