<i>Inside</i> is an extraordinary puzzle platformer that acts as the spiritual successor to <i>Playdeads</i> past venture <i>Limbo</i>. <i>Limbo </i>was an absolute jewel, yet somehow, <i>Inside</i> manages to surpass these high standards and subsequently set a new benchmark for the indie game market. I feel like I am Nathan Drake and <i>Inside</i> is the treasure. If you have a spare $30, I can't think of a better way to spend it.
