Troll and I is a third person action-adventure, that has straightforward puzzles that require both Otto and the troll to complete.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The combat in Troll and I is clunky and often difficult to defeat even the most basic enemies.The camera in troll and I is way to close to the character which makes viewing the world often difficult with Otto and even harder with the troll which takes up half of the screen making movement and combat with the troll a chore. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game is also plagued by too many quick time events, which don&#039;t add anything to the game and just serve as a faster way to move you along the world and one step closer to yet another nonengaging cut scene. &lt;br&gt;
