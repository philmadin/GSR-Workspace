The audio in Sniper Elite 4 is one of its greatest strengths. Every time you pull the trigger it packs a punch, and the sound of bones breaking and organs spluttering as you enter the X-Ray kill cam never got old.&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also use the sounds in your environment against your enemy. Planes flying over head or busted generators can mask Karl&#039;s shots, leaving your prey scrambling in fear and disarray.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
