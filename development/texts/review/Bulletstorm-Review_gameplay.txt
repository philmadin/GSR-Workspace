Leash bad guy. Kick bad guy in to air. Shoot.<br />
This is basically Bulletstorm in a nutshell, but it hardly gets boring. I found some of the NPC patterns were easy to memorise, meaning I was given a little mercy on a few of the more tedious levels.<br />
<br />
Kicking enemies into Cacti, electrical lines, shooting them in their naughty bits or getting headshots. This and more will score you points through different combos. <br />
You then use these points to buy armour, guns, ammo and more importantly charge shots; which with the right aim, will give you the ability to one hit just about anything excluding most bosses. <br />
<br />
Although keep in mind that charge shots are expensive.<br />
<br />
Bosses in this game were great fun, and some of the guns were very impressive plus with two separate Co-op game modes to play after the story, there's plenty more to do once youâ€™ve torn up the main missions.<br />
