It&#039;s quite interesting to find that for a game that&#039;s based on fighting, you don&#039;t actually do any. The fights themselves are automated affairs that have you battling real opponents (yes, this is an online-only game). The robots automatically move and fire their weapons, and success is determined by how well you have designed your robot.&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where C.A.T.S. shines. Choosing between a tank or a sneaky body, missile launcher or drill, boosters or lifter, you will constantly be making compromises as you try to design the perfect robot - but that is simply not possible. Robot bodies have attachment and power limitations, and it&#039;s up to you to figure out how to best utilise them. Even once you find something that works well, you will inevitably come up against an opponent that is able to exploit your one and only weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best part is that losing never feels unfair. The matchmaking system does a good job of matching you against beatable opponents, and you&#039;ll find yourself changing your configuration between fights to keep on top of the ladder. The latest update has added the ability to store your favourite designs which makes adapting that much easier. Even if you come up against an adversary you can&#039;t beat, seasons only last a day or two, meaning you rarely get stuck whilst trying to progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you rank up, you&#039;ll get access to more powerful parts, but so do your opponents. You have a steady stream of new parts that come in via crates and at no point have I felt that you&#039;ve needed to pay to win. Ads are also very unobtrusive and exist only if you want to speed up crate unlock times.&lt;/p&gt;
