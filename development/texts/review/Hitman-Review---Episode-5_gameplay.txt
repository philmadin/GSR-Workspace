This mission has far fewer scripted Opportunities than previous episodes, albeit some more memorable ones such as 3D printing someone&#039;s face, arming someone&#039;s watch, and completing a militia training exercise.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It works because this episode is smaller in scale and significantly harder than previous ones - everyone is armed besides a few hackers, and Agent 47 is a trespasser from the moment the level begins. It&#039;s rare that you&#039;ll have a moment alone with a target, and when you do, it&#039;s usually because everyone else in the room is dead. The difficulty is refreshingly different from the metaphorical silver platter you are handed in Sapienza or Bangkok.&lt;/p&gt;
