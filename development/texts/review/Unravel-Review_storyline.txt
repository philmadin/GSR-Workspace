An elderly woman enjoying some photos of the past wanders upstairs, allowing Yarny to take to the stage. Yarny, a small, figurine-sized spindle of twine goes out in search of memories to place in his scrapbook. With each level, selected by climbing the inside of the house and diving into photo frames, we are given tiny insights into a life journey and the loss that comes with time.<br />

Initially the story is very vague as it's hard to know where you're headed and why. Yarny collects ghostly images that appear and fade in the background, with each level ending as you acquire a small woollen button. It isnâ€™t until much later that things start to make sense and, whilst both heartwarming and sad, it could easily be forgotten.
