I&#039;m thoroughly enjoying my time with &lt;i&gt;Soul Knight&lt;/i&gt;, more than I thought I would. I&#039;m wanting to pump out a few levels wherever I can not to level up my character and abilities, but simply because it&#039;s that much fun running through dungeons shooting stuff. It&#039;s also a free game with no pesky ads (unless you want bonus coins) which is rare for mobile games these days. It definitely ticks a lot of boxes for me, and for that, I can&#039;t recommend &lt;i&gt;Soul Knight &lt;/i&gt;enough.
