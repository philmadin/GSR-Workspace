<i>Dark Souls 3</i> is a brilliant game with annoying flaws. New comers beware, you wonâ€™t feel as welcome as in <i>Dark Souls 2</i>. Veterans however will no doubt naw on this bone for years to come. Hopefully in a few months time and a few patches, Dark Souls 3 will stand tall as both a stunning game and piece of art.
