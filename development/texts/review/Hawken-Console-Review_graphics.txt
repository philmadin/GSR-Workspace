Unfortunately, console gaming is still rough when it comes to PC ports. So far I have yet to have an flawless experience, with disconnects and game crashes. The frame rate also drops far too often, resulting in combat that feels more chaotic than it needs to be, purely because the frame rate dips and rises so frequently.Visually, the game is a bit weird. Interiors of the mechs resemble the extreme, horrific close ups in Spongebob Squarepants, and the rest of the world suffers from blurry textures and texture pop in.
