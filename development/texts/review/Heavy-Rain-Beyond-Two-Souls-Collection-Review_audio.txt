A very big difference between the two titles is the acting talent. <i>Beyond Two Souls</i> makes excellent use of Ellen Page and Willem Dafoe. Their experience in acting provides believable and emotionally engaging characters that pull you along. On the other hand, <i>Heavy Rain</i> consists a cast that arenâ€™t entirely convincing in their roles for long periods of time. Dramatic exchanges can be thwarted by flip flopping accents that range all across the American dialect.The soundtracks for both games are extremely strong, aiding in the emotional gravitas of a scene. Particularly <i>Heavy Rain</i>.
