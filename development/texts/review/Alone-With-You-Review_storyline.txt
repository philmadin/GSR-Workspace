<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You, the last remaining person on a dying planet, need to repair your escape pod and evacuate before joining the planet in itâ€™s fate in just a few weeks. To do this, you scavenge through defunct facilities and communicate with the holograms of former employees stationed across the planet. Building relationships and gathering clues as to what went wrong and how best to escape. The narrative is delivered in text dialogue from the A.I of your ship and those of Holograms, plus the logs and notes you find scattered about.</span></p><p class="p2"><i>Alone with You</i> is slow - very slow. Your daily routine of waking up, heading out on a mission, coming home, then talking with the Holograms of employees is likely enough to cut some peoples experience short. Trips to the other facilities are tedious and mostly involve a lot of reading. After 5 or 6 days on this planet however, the narrative shift towards a stronger sense of progression. Instead of just visiting the other Colony facilities, you start to unravel the true level of deterioration the Planet was suffering and the personal strains it was taking on the colonists.<br></p><p class="p2">Final completion of <i>Alone With You</i> is almost unexpected. Touching and heartbreaking, what starts as mundane ultimately leaves you wishing for just a bit more time.<br></p>
