<br>This episode is jaw dropping, there is no other way to put it. I'll try to put this as best I can without spoiling anything. If you were worried about the Penguin's portrayal, don't worry about it. If you were worried about the game shoving the death of the Waynes down our throats, don't worry about it. If you were worried there would be too much Bruce Wayne and not enough Batman, then for goodness sake don't worry about it! Everything is better this time around and the initial concerns I had after ROS have nearly all been rectified. Strap yourself in for excellent <i>Batman</i> storytelling, this is up there with <i>Batman The Animated Series</i> in terms of quality.&nbsp;
