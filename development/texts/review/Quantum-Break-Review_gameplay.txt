Though a third person shooter, Quanum Break has a lot more going for it that its initial Uncharted-aping look.As a 'shifter', Jack has access to an array of powers that spice up the action. He can slow time, envelop enemies in 'freeze bubbles', create a healing shield, zoom between cover and find 'fractures' in the environment that allow him to rewind events.&nbsp;<p><br></p><p>&nbsp;It really is all quite clever, and I applaud Remedy for trying something new. Particular highlights include segments when time freezes completely, occasionally speeding forward or backward in the middle of explosive set-pieces.Of course, the other big thing is the TV show.
