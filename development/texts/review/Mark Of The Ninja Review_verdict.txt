An amazing attention to detail in all aspects has refined the gameplay into a stealth experience that places you into the shoes of the ninja in the first few seconds of every level. Poor combat and penalties as well as occasionally difficult controls barely make an impact on the otherwise flawless gameplay experience.<br />

If you enjoy platforming, stealth, or trying to kill guards by scaring other guards into shooting wildly, Mark Of The Ninja is for you. And if you have played it, but you don't see it as one of the greatest platformers or stealth games available, I urge you to go back and play it again.<br />

And if you've played it and you loved it, play it again anyway.
