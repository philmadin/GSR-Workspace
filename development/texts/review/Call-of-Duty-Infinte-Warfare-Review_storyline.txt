There is an ongoing war for the control of the solar system between the Settlement Defence Front (SDF ) and the United Nations Space Alliance (UNSA).&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game puts you in the shoes of Nick Reyes, a UNSA pilot who becomes the leader of &#039;The Retribution&#039;, a UNSA warship, when the captain of the ship dies mid mission. &amp;nbsp;Reyes is left the highest ranking official on board.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;This exposes Reyes as a vulnerable leader who puts safety of his team first rather than completing the mission at hand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;The SDF leader and commander of the warship &#039;Olympus Mons&#039;, Admiral Salen Kotch will do anything to bring UNSA to it&#039;s knees and take over the Earth. Infinite Warfare has several likeable NPC&#039;s like Reyes&#039; wingman Nora Salter and his Robot sidekick E3N Ethan who help out in Reyes&#039; plans to defeat the SDF.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game allows you to choose your own missions which are of varying difficulty. Each mission has a different objective located on a different planet and tells you how it would help you in taking town the SDF which makes the story feel a lot more genuine and not just a mindless shooter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
