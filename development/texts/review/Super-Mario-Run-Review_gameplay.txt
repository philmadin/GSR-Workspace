&lt;p&gt;Mario will automatically run and it&#039;s up to you to jump, vault and parkour your way to the end of each of the 24 levels. Each move is performed with a single tap and is context sensitive, meaning that the wide array of abilities on offer are always available when you need them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A wide selection of locations and enemies keep the levels feeling fresh, and are set out with three levels per world; climaxing in a boss level/battle before moving to the next. Unfortunately, the boss battle at the end of each world is a trivial three-hit affair, and with Mario&#039;s limited movement, simply comes down to timing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lasting appeal, however, comes from the five special coins found in each and every level. These require you to perfect your timing and memorise their locations to collect them all in the same run. Once done, a second and then the third run is unlocked, each more difficult than the last. Extra characters such as Yoshi or Luigi can also be unlocked, providing you with new play styles to help get that last coin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#039;Toad Rally&#039; is a secondary mode that sees you competing with other players to collect the most coins in the most stylish manner possible. The winner sways the Toad spectators to move into your Kingdom, which in turn unlocks bonus buildings and cosmetics. These are purchased with coins earned in game, allowing you to rebuild the Kingdom however you see fit. While a tad superfluous, it does serve as a good distraction from the campaign and opens up bonus levels if you sink enough time into it.&lt;/p&gt;
