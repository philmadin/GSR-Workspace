<br><i>Oceanhorn</i> is a good but not great action adventure that borrows heavily from the <i>Zelda</i> games it is derived from. With <i>Oceanhorn 2: Knights of the Lost Realm</i> currently in development, there is no reason to believe that Cornfox &amp; Bros won't listen to fan feedback and provide an even better game that can pave its own way in the genre.
