&lt;p&gt;The gameplay is where the fun is at. Because they&#039;ve stripped the game down a bit, it&#039;s very easy for beginners to pick up. But since the NPCs level up as you do, it gets more challenging as you learn. And right as you open the app, it asks whether you have any experience in the card game so it&#039;s good for more experienced players as well.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building your own deck is one of the best parts of the game. On top of winning cards from some NPCs, there&#039;s a shop where you buy packs of cards. There are several themed boxes for the packs, which are swapped out semi-regularly, and you buy these packs with either in-game currency or real money (IAP).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with NPCs, there&#039;s also the PvP Arena that allows you to verse other people who play from around the globe. Real people always bring more of a challenge than NPCs so it&#039;s a good place to test your skills, try out decks, and learn some new strategies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
