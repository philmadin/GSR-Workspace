&lt;i&gt;Paladins: Champions of The Realm&lt;/i&gt; is a fun and engaging alternative to all of the other first person team based shooters out in the marketplace, although it has no storyline. There is not really a downside to that with all of the character voice clips and efforts put into the character design of each champion, they tell their own story if you look into them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The gameplay is fun, easy to learn but hard to master, and if you do not give into the micro-payment to unlock everything, there is hours worth of reward that can only be unlocked through gameplay. Seeing as &lt;i&gt;Paladins&lt;/i&gt; is only in the open beta stage of development, all the problems that come up during gameplay will no doubt be ironed out and this will become a stand out of the team based shooter genre.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you&#039;re looking for a new game to play with some friends or just want a break from &lt;i&gt;Overwatch&lt;/i&gt;, give &lt;i&gt;Paladins: Champions of The Realm&lt;/i&gt; a try - it&#039;s free after all.&lt;br&gt;
