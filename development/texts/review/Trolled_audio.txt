The soundtrack of Troll and I is the highlight of the game. The ambient music really sets the tone for each stage, the combat music brings the duller stages of the game to life and engages the player to fight all the foes until none are left standing.The voice acting in Troll and I is sporadic across the game, some characters have lines delivered with a purpose that makes the scene engaging for the player, and then there is Otto who has an accent that travels across Europe over the course of the game.&lt;br&gt;
