The game is gorgeous. Environments are filled to the brim with details. They feel open, with vast draw distances and nothing to block the impressive views. There is always something happening, giving the planet a sense of life. <p align="LEFT" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; margin-bottom: 0cm;">Everything is rendered beautifully. The game has dramatically improved from the <i style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; margin-bottom: 0cm;">PlayStation 3</i> era. Characters and enemies have more expressions and unique personalities stemming from the amount of detail poured into them. To see individual strands of fur on Ratchet and an even shinier Clank, shows how far the series has come as a whole.</p>
