&lt;p&gt;Colours, shadows, lighting effects, seemingly endless draw-distance. I could go on and on about the amazing graphic elements of this game. This game is a visual masterpiece. The smoke, neon and special effects are sublime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is hands down one of the most visually detailed games out on any console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is more to a game than its visual effects but sometimes it&#039;s good to sit back and enjoy them.&lt;/p&gt;
