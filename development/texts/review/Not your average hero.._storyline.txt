In the outskirts of the Ash Mountains, there lies a crusty region called Mordor; capturing the devastating debris of Mount Doom. Not far from there, players resume the role of a Gondorian Ranger called Talion, whom is ritually executed alongside his family in the first few moments of the game. <br />

Following the feudal death of Talion, an elven wraith transmutes into Talon’s body and seeks revenge against Sauron's army. Now alive with superhuman powers, Talion single handily devours Sauron’s forces, and tries to avenge his family.<br />
