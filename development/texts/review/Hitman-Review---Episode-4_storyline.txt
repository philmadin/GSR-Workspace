The briefing for this mission is as simple as &lt;i&gt;Hitman &lt;/i&gt;gets: Jordan Cross, a young rockstar, seems to be behind the murder of his girlfriend and the client&#039;s daughter. His silver-tongued attorney, Ken &quot;The Brick&quot; Morgan, then covered it up. Hence, the clients want both of these men dead. But it&#039;s when the mission ends and the cutscene plays that the curtain of this revenge plot is pulled back to reveal a darker driving force that pulls all the previous episodes together nicely.
