Ninja is a marvel visually, aurally, and in stealth gameplay. A wide array of tools at the playerâ€™s disposal creates many different play styles and options, and while guards are sometimes too easy to handle, the maps compensate for this with challenge, exploration, and non-linear options.<br />

A simple yet novel approach to stealth as well as a wide array of tools and options means replayability. The storyline and incredible audio help to immerse the player. I would recommend Mark Of The Ninja to anyone who likes stealth, platformers, or scaring guards to death with the bodies of their fallen brothers.
