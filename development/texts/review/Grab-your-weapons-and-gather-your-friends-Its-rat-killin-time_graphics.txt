This game is by no means ugly. A plethora of settings allow for a player to optimise their experience, as a few options (Shadows) cause a notable amount of lag. Despite this, Fatshark have nailed the Warhammer vibe, with a wide variety of locations that all look and feel just as the Warhammer universe would. Characters and enemies all look great. Playing around with the settings will allow it to play on just about any rig whilst still being a good looking game.
