Blending realistic environments with the destructible LEGO bricks, Jurassic World is similar to its predecessors. The game does not miss a single detail. It succeeds in capturing the atmosphere of the iconic scenes, including the T-Rex paddock and cliff rescue. While not visually spectacular, it is faithful to the original art direction of the films.
