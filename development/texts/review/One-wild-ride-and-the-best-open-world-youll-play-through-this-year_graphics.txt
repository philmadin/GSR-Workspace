The world of Wild Hunt has been decimated by war and bloodshed. To have a world appear so filthy and cruel but also so beautiful and glorious to behold is fascinating. As a Witcher, a warrior cursed with abilities of strength, power and magic, you’ll find yourself on a different plane to the many nobles, peasants and villagers who fear the unnatural and arcane. You’ll be treated as an outsider – and you’ll feel like one – but this just allows you to appreciate the world around you even more. Across the lush greens of Skellige, the muddy planes of Velen and the bustling streets of Novigrad, it’s easy to just sink into how alive everything feels. Frame rate stutters and frequent pop-in textures can pull you out of this immersion but only if you let them. The beauty of Wild Hunt, and it is truly staggering to witness sometimes, is all about the bigger picture.
