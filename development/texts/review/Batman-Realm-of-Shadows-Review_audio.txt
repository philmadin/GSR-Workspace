The dark audio present in <i>ROS</i> feels very appropriate for the subject matter at hand. The theme music and overlapping sounds during set pieces all make you feel like you really are in an epic adventure. <br><br><p>The greatest achievement of the audio presentation is without a doubt the performances of the cast. The voice acting in this game is excellent, which is certainly saying a lot considering that usual <i>Batman</i> performers Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill were entirely absent.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Troy Baker plays our hero and does a convincing job as our latest Dark Knight. Selina Kyle as you would expect is seductive and illusive while Harvey is headstrong and confident. I hope that the same standard applies to the rest of the episodes to come.&nbsp;</p>
