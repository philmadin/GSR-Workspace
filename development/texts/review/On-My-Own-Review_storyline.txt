Choose your gender and off you go. <i>On My Own</i> is about living day to day on your own amongst nature. Over the course of the seasons you and your character will learn to use the land to your advantage, living apart from society. There is no narrative but what you make for yourself. Wandering around you may find Letters that detail how to make special items, but with a flair of a tiny story or quirky description. Item descriptors in your Journal are lighthearted; in fact, everything has a very calm overtone. Instead of applying pressure to progress, you could simply stay at the cabin forever more.
