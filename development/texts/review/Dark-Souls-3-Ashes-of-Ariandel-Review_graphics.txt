After an entire game of greys and stone, it’s unfortunate to be met with yet more white/grey snow and stone. <i><br><br>Dark Souls</i> has presented a variety of locales in DLC before, from the perilous walk across the thick chain in <i>Dark Souls 2</i> to access Brume Tower, or the underground Pyramids of Shulva. <i>Ashes of Ariandel</i> however, whilst altered in some ways, is essentially treading the same old ground. Even the final boss is shades of what has come before.<br><br>On the plus side, regular enemies are a much better addition than content in the previous instalments. You aren’t just fighting Hollow Man Version 2.0, instead you face off against giant clawed monsters, insects that spit worms, wolves and what can be best described as Vikings that are unique to the DLC which is exciting. <br><br>And when the old does make way for the new, there’s that bizarre <i>Dark Souls</i> madness to be found just when you start to feel safe.
