Because our main character isn’t a rookie anymore he’ll have a lot more challenges to face including engaging with a prestigious prosecutor from Germany that’s been practising since they were 13-years-old.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:" georgia",serif"="" lang="EN-AU"><br></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:" georgia",serif"="" lang="EN-AU"><br></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:" georgia",serif"="" lang="EN-AU">Overall, <span style="font-size:12px;"><i style="font-size: 12px;">Justice for All</i></span> doesn’t quite live up to the standards that the first game brought. The second and fourth cases bring a lot to the table with the introduction of fascinating new characters and the set-up of a plot that extends into the third game. Unfortunately, the third case is considered the worst in the series by many fans.&nbsp; <br></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><br></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:" georgia",serif"="" lang="EN-AU">It’s a story that’s set in a circus where the ringmaster was killed. It’s disliked so heavily because of not only the absurdity of the case (which, in this series, is saying something) but also because of the characters. Moe the Clown and Ben and Trilo were hard to deal with because of their obnoxious personalities and Regina Berry was just plain dumb. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:" georgia",serif"="" lang="EN-AU"><br></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:" georgia",serif"="" lang="EN-AU"><br></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:" georgia",serif"="" lang="EN-AU">Thankfully, the last case of the game is easily the best. The stakes are raised when Maya Fey is kidnapped and Phoenix is forced defend the TV star, Matt Engarde. With several characters from the first game being reintroduced and the potential of getting a ‘Bad Ending’, you’ll be on the edge of your seat.&nbsp;</span></p>
