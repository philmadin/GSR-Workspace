&lt;i&gt;DiRT 4&lt;/i&gt;&#039;s audio is mostly what you would expect from a racing game. The cars sound realistic, the ambient sounds of the forest and Australian outback are life-like, and the crowd sounds add another layer to the immersive feeling of the game. The soundtrack is amazing, with songs from The Hives, Wolfmother, and Queens Of The Stoneage all featuring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
