For a shoot &#039;em up to succeed, it needs to play well. One should be able to zip around the map with ease, target and destroy enemies and have enough variation in foes to keep things interesting. Above all else, it should be fair - often difficult - but always fair. Enemies have predictable attacks, projectiles move along fixed paths and you&#039;re given the tools to deal with any situation. In &lt;i&gt;Nex Machina&lt;/i&gt; however, there isn&#039;t even a tutorial.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After being unceremoniously thrown into a PC game with controller key prompts (not a good start), I managed to flail around for a little while before coming to a terrible realisation; &lt;i&gt;Nex Machina&lt;/i&gt; is blatantly unfinished. At least, I hope it is for the alternative, which is the devs thinking this is a releasable title. That is far worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no indication of what pickups do, there are enemies that a entirely random, levels seem to be haphazardly thrown together without any consideration to either balance or enjoyment, and it feels like it&#039;s running on decade old hardware. Throw in some egregious visuals and the most boring sound design you&#039;ve ever heard and you&#039;ll doubt that this is the same team behind &lt;i&gt;Resogun&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
