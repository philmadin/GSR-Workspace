Troll and I is a game that has ambition and tries to do a lot of things but just doesn&#039;t do much of it right, combat is a chore and the story telling so slow to build, most players would have checked out. I feel that if this game was bought out a few years ago during the last console generation, it would have passed, but for the current console generation, it just doesn&#039;t belong.If the developers were given more time to work on smoothing out all the rough edges this game would have come out better.&lt;br&gt;
