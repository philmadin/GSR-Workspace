The music in the game felt like it was mostly absent except during cutscenes. Whether or not it was deliberate, the game was missing its usual personality. Considering the overall game, Naughty Dog may have been aiming for a more somber tone for this adventure. The voice acting was superb, with notable performances from Troy Baker and Nolan North. The banter between them was funny and added more depth to their characters.
