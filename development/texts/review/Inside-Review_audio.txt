Honestly, what <i>Playdead </i>have done with the audio presentation is quite remarkable. <i>Inside </i>has no lines of dialogue and mostly relies on environmental and natural sounds, yet this is not a detriment. The sound of the boys heavy breathing is perfectly synchronised with his chest animation. He displays cries of panic when he is being chased and exhales large sighs of relief after danger has passed. The attention to detail is phenomenal. <i style="text-align: start;">Insides</i><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); text-align: start;"> composer </span><span style="text-align: start;"><font color="#252525" face="sans-serif">Martin Stig Andersen has done a commendable job of creating atmospheric tension. When I was walking through a submerged laboratory of some kind I noticed these chilling piano notes throughout the background, almost like a siren tempting me to explore deeper into the abyss. The music present can best be described as subdued, pensive but most of all completely effective. High quality headphones are an absolute must to get the most out of this production.  </font></span>
