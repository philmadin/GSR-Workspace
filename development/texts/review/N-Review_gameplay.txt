<br>Gameplay is pure platforming bliss with jumping and sliding both ultra responsive. You run along at break neck speeds to finish each level in under the 90 second timeframe all to have it come crashing down at one minor twitch of the joystick. This is all apart of the fun as each 'episode' gets increasingly more difficult which will test even the most seasoned platform player.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">This all rings praise to the level design as each new episode feels unique and challenging from the get go.</span><i> <br><br></i><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">If you have a controller lying around try playing for more accurate leaps and precision, just don't get frustrated if you don't make that last jump on your first try. The game is also great fun with friends, so make sure they bring their controllers for fantastic co-op mayhem.</span></p>
