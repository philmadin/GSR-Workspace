Overall, <i>Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney</i> is a fantastic entry in the <i>Ace Attorney</i> series. It gets overlooked quite a bit because of its weaker story but the music, graphics, and characters more than make up for that. And while the more readily available HD port makes the game look a lot smoother, the original DS version is beautiful as is.
