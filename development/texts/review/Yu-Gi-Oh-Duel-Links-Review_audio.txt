&lt;p&gt;In original Japanese anime, the soundtrack was always spectacular. In the app, though, it&#039;s your usual stock-standard background music. It has exciting music for special Duels or when you&#039;re about to lose or win and just a fun beat for the general background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This app has voice acting from the original cast of the dub anime. The voice actors say a few lines for before, during, and after the Duel. There are special lines for when particular characters are versing each other and all the lines, though a tad stiff in some cases are otherwise acted well.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
