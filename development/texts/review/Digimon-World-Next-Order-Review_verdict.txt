This game may seem simple at first glance but becomes more complex as you spend more time with it. It may not appeal to everyone but the micro-managing of your Digimon can get repetitive as you need certain stats in order to progress. The lack of involvement with your Digimon is the biggest letdown as it is all an automatic process with your occasional command thrown in. If you stick with it, you will be rewarded...eventually.&lt;br&gt;
