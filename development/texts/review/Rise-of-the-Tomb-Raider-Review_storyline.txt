&lt;p&gt;The story continues from the previous instalment. One year after its events transpired, Lara Croft finds herself suffering from PTSD as she had to kill in order to survive. Chasing immortality (the Divine Source), Lara turns to her late father&#039;s research on a lost city of Kitezh. She is warned by Ana that Kitezh was what brought doom upon her father. In her quest, Lara is interrupted by Trinity- an ancient order of knights turned paramilitary force seeking what she seeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trinity has a dominating influence and has taken over several bases. Lara is outmatched and heavily outnumbered until she happens to meet Jacob, leader of the Remnant. United against a common enemy, Jacob and Lara fend off Trinity&#039;s attacks. Meanwhile, Lara&#039;s friend Jonah is captured by Trinity and suffers fatal injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;Lara takes Jonah to Jacob and who miraculously heals Jonah and is revealed to be the &quot;Deathless Prophet&quot; mentioned in the legends of Kitezh.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Trinity on their tail, Lara is forced to enter Kitezh and runs into the &#039;deathless ones&#039;, the guardians of the city. She then realises that the immortality comes with a price- sense of self. The immortals know of nothing but protecting Kitezh. Lara reaches the Divine Source and retrieves it from the hands of one of the Trinity leaders Ana and smashes it killing all the deathless ones and hence ending Jacob&#039;s immortality. Lara also discovers that her father was murdered by Trinity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jacobs daughter Sofia has now taken command of the Remnant. Lara questions Ana if she killed her father and Ana denies it but informs her that she had orders from Trinity to kill him. Before she could reveal more information, she is shot dead by a Trinity assassin but Lara&#039;s life seems to have been spared for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
