Without seeing any of the campaign, and with the option to fight AI disabled, I cannot recommend you purchase Dawn of War III on release, at least not at full price anyway. Unless the single player winds up being a 20 hour long epic and Relic announces more free content within weeks of release, there isn&#039;t enough here to justify $80. While it is fun and it is an undeniably good game and a worthy entry into the franchise, based on my beta experience there just isn&#039;t enough content to justify a purchase on release. As it stands, wait for a sale.
