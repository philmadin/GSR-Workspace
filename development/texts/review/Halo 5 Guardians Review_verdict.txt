This competitive scene is one of the strongest and enjoyable entries iâ€™ve experienced in the series since Halo 3. Yet the story suffers from being the middle child in what is clearly setting up the next instalment. Perhaps in time it will be remembered with greater enthusiasm. For now it is a very solid entry that takes back the mantle of true competitive, balanced and rewarding multiplayer.
