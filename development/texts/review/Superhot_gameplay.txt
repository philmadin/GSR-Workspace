<p class="MsoNormal">The underlying basics of Superhot don’t differ from anyother first person shooter in any great way; you walk through the environment,laying waste to the bad guys. <o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">In this sense the game is simplistic, with no secrets orsecondary objectives to distract you. You kill the bad guys, you move on to thenext level.  However this single-mindedfocus on The Matrix like set piece shoot outs showpieces it’s party trick gamemechanic; time only moves when you do.  <o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal"> Unlike its fast paced,twitchy brethren, Superhot will have you taking a much slower and moreconsidered approach. <o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">Carefully surveying your surroundings and carefullychoreographing your every movement is key. While stationary, bullets movealmost imperceptibly slowly towards you, and enemies are frozen in place.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal"> Only when you takeaction, by moving, shooting, or using objects around you as weapons does timespeed up. In no time you will be dodgingbullets, disarming enemies and shattering enemies into a million shiny redpieces.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">The simple gameplay means Superhot is very easy to grasp,and the difficulty ramps in a beautifully linear fashion, but it never getsincredibly challenging. And it’s over quickly, with the main game only taking acouple of hours to complete. <o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">The replays are worth a mention too. They play back in realtime after each level, making your slow methodical play look suddenly like youjust raced through gunning down everyone like the possessed love child of JohnWick and Jason Bourne.<o:p></o:p></p>
