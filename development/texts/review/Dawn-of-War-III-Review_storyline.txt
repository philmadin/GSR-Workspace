The Wandering World of Acheron, a planet lost to the warp, is about to reemerge after 5000 years. On it is the legendary Spear of Khaine, an ancient Eldar relic said to slay any enemy in a single blow. The armies of the Swordwind, led by Autarch Khyre, seek to claim in fulfilment of a prophecy. Farseer Macha believes the prophecy to be wrong and begins a schism in an attempt to prevent the Eldar&#039;s undoing. Gabriel Angelos, now Chapter Master of the Blood Ravens, is determined to destroy the spear, decreeing that none should have it. The Orks, lead by Gorgutz, simply want a fight, and it&#039;s going to be a big ones.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plot isn&#039;t anything new and, for all intents and purposes, is nearly identical to the first game. The campaign begins as not much more than an extensive tutorial but gets more interesting the longer it progresses. Each mission alternates between the three mission and while it does give the player the chance to experience everything the game has to offer, it&#039;s also incredibly jarring as it&#039;s not until the final missions that you truly feel comfortable with whoever your playing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, it&#039;s pretty fun. There&#039;s a couple of hero focused missions that bring back memories of &lt;i&gt;Warcraft 3&lt;/i&gt; which is by no means a bad thing and the returning characters are done well and much appreciated. It&#039;s also a decent length, taking around 15 hours to complete so there&#039;s no problems there.&lt;/p&gt;
