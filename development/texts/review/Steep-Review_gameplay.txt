With not much story to follow, the gameplay will either sway you or leave you loathing Steep. If you love watching GoPro footage from base-jumpers, or want to feel the thrill of snowboarding down a snowy mountain-side, then this is the game for you. Each play-style feels unique (apart from snowboarding and skiing which use the same base mechanics) and caters for casual gamers, making it accessible for anyone.<p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Wingsuitting is a definite highlight, as making it through small gaps in a rocky cliffside is always an achievement. You feel accomplished if you make a risky maneuver or land an impressive trick as the reward system is forgiving, allowing you to unlock extra gear and better drop zones. <br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Much like the game 'Skate', You are able to restart a challenge if you make a mistake and get straight back into the action which keeps the game flowing nicely. The trick system is also quick to learn, allowing you to pull off great lines with ease. Having the ability to switch to a different sport at any time is also a plus as it allows you to explore different paths you have uncovered without any load time. </p><p></p>
