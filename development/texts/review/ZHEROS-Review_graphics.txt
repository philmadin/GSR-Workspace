&lt;i&gt;ZHEROS&lt;/i&gt; has a very Saturday morning cartoon looking art style, which carries over all of the levels of the game and never comes across as an eyesore. The background of each level are very active and lively with a lot of moving parts that make you feel like you are really in that environment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While playing through &lt;i&gt;ZHEROS&lt;/i&gt;, I only had one graphical glitch, which occurred while traveling down an elevator at the end of the level this however only lasted for maybe two seconds. All up &lt;i&gt;ZHEROS&lt;/i&gt; looks great in every way. &lt;br&gt;
