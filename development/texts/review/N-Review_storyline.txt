<br>Beginning as a flash game in 2004, <i>N++</i> sees the silhouetted ninja doing what he has been doing for the last 10 years - dodging lasers, bombs and collecting gold nodes. Being a indie roots platformer, the game doesn't have a traditional storyline, instead placing players into different 'episodes' with each episode containing five levels to complete. Boasting over 2000 levels, you won't run out of content any time soon and with a great community creating levels everyday, the game continues to grow.&nbsp;
