<i>Cossacks 3</i> has some good audio, most notably the sound effects, which all sound appropriate enough. Unfortunately, any good will found there is lost, not in the quality of the music, but in when it plays. I've heard battle music play while farming and tranquil music play in pitched battle. It completely kills the experience and I often find myself turning it off.
