Outside of the new airborne units (which are so useless and obviously unfinished they&#039;re barely worth mentioning), and the new races, everything is standard fare (with a little re-balancing here and there). The biggest shifts come in the form of the Dark Eldar, the vile and twisted cousins of the Eldar; and the Sisters of Battle, pseudo Space Marines who prefer fire over bullets.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new races really aren&#039;t that interesting, both feature a new resource unique to them and them only,&amp;nbsp; which adds nothing to the gameplay, at all. The Sisters are kind of fun if you like incinerating everything in sight but can&#039;t stand up to ranged combat. The Dark Eldar are manic and psychotic, playing like Eldar but even more useless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, there&#039;s nothing special here, but nothing overly awful here, it&#039;s just kind of average.&lt;/p&gt;
