The world of Troll and I looks great and gives off a graphic novel feel, similar to the look of the state of decay series. Unfortunately, that does not extend into the design of the characters who look like they would be fine in the last console generation. The stationary animations of the characters in certain environments show jumps from textured to smooth rendering at a constant rate depending on how long you stand still.&lt;br&gt;
