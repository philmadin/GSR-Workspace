Blizzard has managed to create a game that is filled with a cast of unique characters backed up with well rounded gameplay. For an online shooter, it is fairly balanced with advantages and counters for each character. All the characters are likeable and it makes it tricky to pick a favourite. <i>Blizzard</i> has another potential winner on their hands and needs to make sure they listen to the community, otherwise only the dedicated few will support it.
