Sound is a mixed bag. Some themes like New LA or combat are blighted by bad rapping and singing, though I eventually got used to it. Other scores fare much better, with Mira themes being quite wonderful.<br><br>Voice acting is okay. Some performances are dull (Elma) or aggravating (Tatsu), but others are much better, such as the dyslexic alien L, or the arrogant H.B. Text translation is quite excellent in comparison, with some genuinely hilarious dialogue that almost made me wish voices were ditched entirely!<br>
