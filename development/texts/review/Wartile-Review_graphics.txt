&lt;i&gt;Wartile&lt;/i&gt; feels like you are playing a table-top RTS, much like you would find set up in a board game shop. Detailed environments and carefully crafted character models all add to the feel Playwood Project is shooting for. Environments change depending on which quest you choose, as well as the enemies within these environments. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wartile&#039;s&lt;/i&gt; character customization is more detailed than it appears at first glance; a plethora of weapons varying from close to ranged combat, as well as clothing options, make the player take the time to carefully plan loadouts for the quest at hand.&lt;br&gt;
