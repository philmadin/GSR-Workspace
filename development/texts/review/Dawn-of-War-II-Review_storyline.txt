While one might expect a smaller campaign from a game with a tighter focus on all aspects, one couldn&#039;t be further from the truth. Like some magical melding of Dawn of War&#039;s narrative-based campaign and Dark Crusade&#039;s approach to more open-ended storytelling, Dawn of War II features both planet hopping and character focused missions.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking up the mantle of a captain of the franchises own Blood Ravens, you must command four squads of space marines, each with their own abilities, and face down the Orks, Eldar and newcomers to the franchise, the Tyranids.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again featuring top notch voice acting and some truly memorable characters, the narrative component is easily the best it&#039;s ever been. Between stomping through Ork hordes, levelling characters and equipping new armour, weapons and abilities, Dawn of War II is a new experience and one wholly worth playing.&lt;/p&gt;
