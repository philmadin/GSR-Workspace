Here&#039;s what I think of Unturned. If achieves everything it set out to do for an incredible price, that being no price at all. Unturned is 100% free to play and, while there is a gold upgrade, this gives no advantages and is more for those who wish to support the game and its dev than to gain any real content. If you want to play a well made open world survival game in which won&#039;t set you back $60, there&#039;s no reason you shouldn&#039;t be playing Unturned right now.
