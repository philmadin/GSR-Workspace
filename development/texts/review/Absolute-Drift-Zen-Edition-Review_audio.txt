<p class="MsoNormal">The audio is typical of a driving game with screeching tires and the subtle sound of brakes being pushed. The squealing of the tires as you drift blend into the background and help you keep focus on your slide with the added help of the throttle. Being able to hear the sound as you back off the gas pedal is a great help for keeping your car under control.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p><p class="MsoNormal">Small bell chime queues let you know when you have progressed through missions and each of the six cars has a distinct sound, which adds to the world on display. I never once had an issue with audio during my play through, cars always revved and tires always burnt out right on queue. <o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p><p class="MsoNormal">Electronic and Drum & Bass music provided by C41 and Nyte helps give depth to what is on display as it fits the art style perfectly.Not only does it fit the game quite well but it helps sell the idea of drifting being an art form, pushing you through each corner and getting you into the game.<o:p></o:p></p>
