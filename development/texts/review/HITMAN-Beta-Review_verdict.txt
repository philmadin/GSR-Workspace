With only a couple of days wait till release, I will be eager to test the full force of the game. Hitman beta is a suitable vehicle for a taste test. <br />

I was originally afraid that after playing the beta, that it would make me depreciate the full game, leaving a sour taste in my mouth - thankfully that didnâ€™t happen. <br />

For anyone who has played the previous instalments, I would highly recommend equipping this game in your library come March 11th. Welcome back, 47.
