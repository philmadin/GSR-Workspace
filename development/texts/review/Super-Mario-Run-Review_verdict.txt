&lt;p&gt;Mario has finally arrived on our mobiles, bringing with him expertly crafted levels and one-touch platforming that is easy to learn but difficult to master. While the general mechanics aren&#039;t anything new, the fluid gameplay and replay value will certainly keep you coming back for more. $15AUD is definitely a steep asking price for a mobile game, but it does get you the impeccable polish and quality that Nintendo is renowned for. Plus it&#039;s ridiculously fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note: The free version of the app offers all the functionality of the paid version, but restricts your campaign access to the first 3 levels of the first world and a 20-second demo of the first castle.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
