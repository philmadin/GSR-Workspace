Josiah may be amazing in every other way, but the graphical fidelity seriously brings this performance to its knees. Pictures posted on the in-game's Facebook are of low quality, and his facial detail clearly hasn't been given any attention (Those eyebrows need some serious plucking). Overall, shocking work from the Roche family on this one. Not even the remarkable gameplay can save Josiah from the mess that is Josiah's visuals.
