As with the intro pack, the graphics for Episode 2 were impressively luscious. There are two key differences here:&nbsp;<p>This episode is much more well lit, which was a welcomed addition considering the unfortunate tradition of washed-out colour schemes in Hitman games.</p><p>The other thing to consider is the ocean, a key feature of the map. It isn't the best ocean in modern games, especially since Just Cause 3 introduced the world to Nvidia WaveWorks, but it is still a marvelous sight.</p><p></p>
