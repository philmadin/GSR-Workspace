Hacknet is primarily text-based, running on a Linux-esque screen where you can interact with an IP map for quick connections and hacking. Learning the codes and remembering the ports you need to type can be difficult, but all add to the wonderful feeling of digitally accessing that which isn’t yours. <br />
