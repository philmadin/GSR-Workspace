&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The story of Fire Emblem: Heroes can perhaps be equated to a combination of Pokemon, and an episode of a Justice League cartoon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Your goal is to recruit classic characters from all over Fire Emblem&#039;s long history, and unite them to defeat all evil doers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Now this might sound super elaborate and fan-service-y, and that&#039;s because it is. A veteran of the franchise will revel in the opportunity to control their favourite characters again, while new players will have to wade through the lacklustre plot without this added nostalgia.&amp;nbsp;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
