The soundtrack of &lt;i&gt;Little Nightmares&lt;/i&gt; is perfect, it changes from environment to environment, situation to situation, constantly playing with the players&#039; emotions. I haven&#039;t played a game in some time that has literally raised my heart rate the way that &lt;i&gt;Little Nightmares&#039;&lt;/i&gt; soundtrack has. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Little Nightmares &lt;/i&gt;has little to no voice acting aside from singing here and there. Instead of enemies saying something like &quot;there you are!&quot; or &quot;I&#039;ve found you!&quot; when an enemy has spotted you they will make a distinctive sound that will make the player think to themselves &quot;Oh crap!&quot; (or some other phrase along those lines).&lt;br&gt;
