&lt;i&gt;Little Nightmares&lt;/i&gt; looks absolutely stunning. There is so much small detail in every environment and background of the game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Little Nightmares&lt;/i&gt; relies heavily on its&#039; background storytelling, subtly hinting certain things to the player without smacking them in the face with a cutscene every five minutes. So much work went into the design of each character to show that everyone is different.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, the janitor is blind but he has a greater hearing and smelling range that help him find yo with his long arms. The chef has the ability to see, smell and hear you but cannot run fast making out running him easier. All of the characters in&lt;i&gt; Little Nightmares&lt;/i&gt; are different and call for a different strategy to pass their areas.&lt;br&gt;
