<p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Titanfall 2 doesn't look as crisp as Battlefield 1 and its frostbite engine nor does it have an exciting art style like an Overwatch, but it does look impressive for a fast paced FPS. From blue particle shields to the orange glint of sunsets in the distance, this game makes a somewhat dated engine still look satisfactory. The character models looked slightly unrealistic but it is hardly an issue when the mechs, abilities and gun fire are all cracking at 60 fps.</span><br></p>
