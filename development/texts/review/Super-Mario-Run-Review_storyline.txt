Princess Peach invites Mario to her castle for a party and the promise of cake (the cake is a lie! - Ed). Bowser, however, is up to his usual tricks, kidnapping the Princess and destroying the castle in the process. Mario is once again tasked with rescuing her, as well as the Toads that fled during the destruction of the castle.
