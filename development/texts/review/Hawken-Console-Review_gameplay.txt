Let’s get to the pointy end of this stick; mechs. Starting your career with a default mech, you are encouraged to dive straight in and wreak as much havoc as you can manage. From lightweights that can fly around the map at top speed to heavy duty models that trudge around with maximum firepower, each mech feels very personable. Your mech can be modified in the garage, tinkered with to look a little more “you” and generally become your unique to your play style. Including the rewards, purchasable comsetics and increasing options in the level up system that maxes at 30, there’s a plethora of options to play with.They also have incredible control. All models use fuel to account for your thrusters which can be used to fly up or boost forward. <br><br>Between this and basic motion and fighting, everything is simple. There are no overly complex button combinations, instead tactics play a stronger role when engaging in combat. Co-operative play is also present with you and four friends taking on waves of enemy mechs or engaging in mock battles with a team of enemy bots. Good training before attempting the competitive game modes.Speaking of which, common candidates are present with Team and regular Deathmatch. Some unique game modes include Siege that has you collecting energy units to revitalise your teams, and Battleship and Missile Assault being a variation on Control Zone gametypes.The game is Free to Play which does mean that money for the game comes from buying skins and cosmetics with your real world money. Given the cost of the game is free, and you don’t even need to buy these extras to have fun, it’s entirely warranted and never punishes you for not paying.
