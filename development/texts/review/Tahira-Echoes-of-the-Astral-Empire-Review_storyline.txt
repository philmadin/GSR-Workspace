A wandering Tahira, having abandoned her home must return to help defend her suffering people from invading forces calling themselves the Astral Empire. <br><br>A great deal of effort has gone towards narrative and immersion. Dialogue is completely text-based and combat mixes well with the regular story quite seamlessly. <br><br>Players make seemingly benign decisions throughout Tahira’s journey that can impact events yet to play out. Stopping to aid one man may result in the death of several others later on.<br>&nbsp;<p>With such a large scope and engaging narrative, especially for Tahira herself and her own personal growth, it does come to a surprisingly abrupt end. <br></p><p><br></p><p>Granted, the game is part of an episodic series, however given the long….looooooong delays of some episodic series, there could have been a more fluid close to this segment of Tahira’s story.</p>
