<p class="MsoNormal" style="width: 668px;">This game is gorgeous, no doubt about it. Every car is beautifully rendered like their real world counterparts and glisten as you drive across a warped version of Australia. It’s clear that the designers have taken liberties with the locations but it all feels like it is supposed to be there with each location fantastically realised as they capture the essence of the Australian continent.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="width: 668px;"><br></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="width: 668px;"><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="width: 668px;">The red dirt of the outback whips up from the wind and the Byron Bay beaches all look stunning, giving way to a lush green rain forest before you’re back between the tall city skyline to catch a real world sunset. You’ll spend more time flying around in drone mode admiring the setting than racing if you’re not careful.</p>
