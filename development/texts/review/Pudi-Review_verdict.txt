&lt;i&gt;Pudi&lt;/i&gt; is a very well-designed arcade game both in terms of gameplay and interface. It&#039;s elegant in its simplicity, pairing simple mechanics with polished controls to provide an experience that is equally rewarding as it is frustrating.&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a very real chance however that it may get lost in the sea of endless arcade apps out there. I don&#039;t believe &lt;i&gt;Pudi&lt;/i&gt; does anything new or exciting enough to differentiate itself from the others, but keep in mind what it does do it does incredibly well. Plus it&#039;s free, so definitely worth a look - and let your competitive streak or OCD do the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
