No real story to speak of here. This remaster adds many welcome improvements but sadly a sound narrative is not one of them.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From what I can gather you are the king of interstellar competitive racing who travels to many different arenas just to show how damn cool you are. The game mechanics and sci-fi aesthetics are reasons to pick up this title, regrettably, a compelling story is not one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
