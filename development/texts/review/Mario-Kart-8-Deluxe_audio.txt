The audio for &lt;i&gt;MK8 Deluxe&lt;/i&gt; is about what you&#039;d expect for a &lt;i&gt;Mario Kart&lt;/i&gt; game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lot&#039;s of &quot;wahoos&quot; and &quot;waaaaahhhs&quot; punctuated by saxophone-charged tunes. It&#039;s frenetic and cheery, and adds to the stress of losing first place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That blue shell beeping still gives me chills...&lt;br&gt;
