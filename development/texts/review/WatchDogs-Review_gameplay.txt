<br>Being an open-world, you have plenty of sites to see and things to do in this virtual rendition of Chicago. With everything connected, the player is able to use the environment to their advantage which adds a great layer of depth to the world. Barriers can be lifted providing you more cover, bridges can be raised to stop the police giving chase, and cameras can be hacked to give you great opportunities for stealth movement.<p><br></p><p>The action is handled well with great third-person shooting mechanics and having the ability to craft hacking weapons such as proximity mines works great in practice. Here is where the game works best as you can use the world around you while still running and gunning, separating itself from other games in the genre. A letdown that needs to be mentioned is the driving mechanics as they feel too arcadey at times as cars slide out and don't quiet handle the way you would expect them to in an open-world setting.</p>
