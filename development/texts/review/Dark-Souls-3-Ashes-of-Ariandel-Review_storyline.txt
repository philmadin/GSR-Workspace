In the Cathedral of the Deep, you come upon a kneeling man who scoops you into his fragment of a painting (with consentâ€¦ sorta). <br><br>Similar to a former artistic plane of existence in <i>Dark Souls</i>, players are transported to a world separated from Lothric and must act as saviour to this frosted realm.The Painted World of Ariamis from <i>Dark Souls</i>, but with NPCs and more ground to cover is the best way to describe Ariandel. <br><br>When players enter Ariandel, the only information they have to go on is find Friede and show them Flame. Typically vague and mysterious, this tiny directive is what normally gives Souls games strength, however without any narrative pressing you on, a somewhat dull environment eats away at the momentum to complete your task.
