<br>Overall, <i>The Last Guardian</i> is a solid game, albeit one that is held back from greatness. Its seven-year gestation has clearly had an effect on the final product, with aged, unfocused gameplay mechanics and inconsistent graphics. However, it does have a tremendous amount of heart, and a wonderful narrative that evokes the specialised experiences of Ueda's previous games. Despite the aggravation I felt, the title is still a worthwhile play, if only so you can finally say "I played <i>The Last Guardian</i>!"<br><br><b>Review copy provided by Sony</b><br><br>
