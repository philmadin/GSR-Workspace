The year is 2065 and the player is tasked with a rescue mission in Ethiopia. While the traditional soldier still exists, it is clear robots and cybernetics are the future now. During the mission, the player is critically injured and is fitted with advanced cybernetics in order to survive. Fast forward five years and the player is now investigating a CIA black site gone quiet and must hunt down the people responsible for leaking classified information.<br />

Unlike its predecessors, Black Ops 3 has opted for the players to make the decision on who they want to be. The cosmetic choice of a male or female soldier has no effect on the story which is the game's downfall. The story is messy and unable to shine due to the lack of a relatable main character. <br />

Treyarch proposes many interesting ideas during the campaign, although, they are mostly left unanswered.  Adding to this, is a confusing ending with a plot twist that seems to fall flat. The story has a poor attempt at adding depth to what is a simple first person shooter.<br />
