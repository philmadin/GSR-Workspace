The soundtrack in this game is nowhere near as striking as any of the previous three games, but it does occasionally have its moments. You are more likely to not notice it unless you are paying close attention, or have clearly entered a story beat.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The voice acting is hit or miss with most of the crew providing excellent performances, but Ryder (same problem with both sexes) has an inability to remain serious. Also, many of the NPC&#039;s sound like they are being forced at gunpoint to read from a script.&lt;/p&gt;
