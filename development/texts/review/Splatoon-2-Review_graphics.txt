The visuals are gorgeous. Running at 1080p and 60 fps (though only 30 fps in Inkopolis, strangely enough), &lt;i&gt;Splatoon 2&lt;/i&gt; is a real looker.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is greatly helped by the outstanding art style; with some of the most original and funky characters and worlds I&#039;ve seen in a videogame.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If I had any qualms, I would say that sometimes the visuals are &lt;i&gt;too&lt;/i&gt; detailed in Hero Mode - making certain things hard to see (though this could just be my terrible eyesight).&lt;br&gt;
