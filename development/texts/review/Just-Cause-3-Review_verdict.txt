Fortunately, JC3 takes everything that was good about JC2 and makes it even better; from the vehicle drops and upgrade systems to the grappling hook. <br />

Unfortunately, it also keeps all the bad things about JC2, like the poor story and sometimes broken physics (although many would argue that this is a positive feature in the franchise). <br />

Even though the game is not quite cooked yet, this medium-rare steak is still an enjoyable and satisfying meal that is well worth the money.<br />

UPDATE (January 2016): many of the bugs have been fixed, and recently my game experience has been completely glitch-free. I have bumped the point scores for both gameplay and graphics up because of this.
