Definitely a step up from the first game, but also remaining unique. The game could be completed by someone without having finished the first and they could still have a blast. Thereâ€™s a reason this game received the acclaim it did and that is the entire package, not just specifics segments, worked like a well oiled machine. Truly a product to be proud of.
