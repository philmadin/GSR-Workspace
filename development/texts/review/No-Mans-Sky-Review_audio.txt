&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;The ambient music fits nicely with each planet, although one can&#039;t help humming &lt;i style=&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;Minecraft &lt;/i&gt;music in reference to the two games&#039; many similarities. In my own experience, there was no music on most of the desolate planets, which was fitting and truly added to the experience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 19.32px;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 19.32px;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;&quot;&gt;While the animal noises were essentially the same call with different effects overlayed onto it, it was still believable enough and varied enough to bring each planet to life.
