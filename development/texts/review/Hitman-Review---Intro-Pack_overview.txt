Under the episodic model, Io-Interactive plan to deliver a rich storytelling experience by providing single episodes at a time. Io-Interactive stated that they plan to have a total of seven episodes by the end of 2016 – the disc release is planned for January 2017.<br />

That being said, I cannot justify a single review for the entire series at this point. Hence, I will be reviewing the intro pack (Prologue = 2 training maps + Paris = one gigantic map). The next map expansion will be available in April then a further release in May.<br />

Although you’d be thinking that this episodic bullcrap needs to stop; it’s really not the case for HITMAN. This game feels perfected in so many ways, and I encourage developers to take their time on the rest of the production. The prices are extremely reasonable for a game that is offering episodes at such high quality (which will be explained), ranging from $10-15 each episode.<br />
