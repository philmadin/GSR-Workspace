The forgeworld Graia, a manufactorum for the Imperium of Man, is under attack by a horde of Ork. Millions of green-skinned aliens ravage the surface of the planet and the Imperial Guard garrison have all but fallen. Enter Captain Titus, followed by Sergeant Sidonus and Leandros, fellow Ultramarines. Upon making planetfall they begin the messy work of clearing the alien threat and soon uncover a more sinister threat.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s not the most original story around but it&#039;s certainly entertaining, as are its characters. Titus himself is voiced by Mark Strong and he brings a truly cinematic feel to every line he speaks. Sidonus and Leandros are equally distinct, as is the rest of the cast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Space Marine brings a decent plot, great characters and some truly cinematic set pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
