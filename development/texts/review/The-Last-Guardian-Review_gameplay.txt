<i><br>The Last Guardian</i> plays like a combination of <i>ICO</i> and <i>Shadow of the Colossus</i>, with the co-operative puzzle gameplay of the former, and the giant creatures of the latter.<br><br>Playing as the boy, you are accompanied by Trico, and together you must work your way through the Nest. The youngster himself can't do much, besides climb and pick up objects, but eventually he'll be able to issue simple commands to his feathery companion, as well as use a special shield that acts as a marker for energy projectiles.<br><br>Trico himself is key to progressing. Initially, the large creature is fairly independent, but soon the player will be able to tell him where to go and what to do; such as providing boosts to high places, jumping to new areas, and helping to bypass a wide array of obstacles. He is also your main method of offence, as strange terracotta soldiers will frequently appear to cause trouble for the duo. These foes will try and wisk the boy away (with button mashing used to escape their clutches), as Trico pummels them mercilessly. It's not exactly the most cerebral of combat systems - Trico cannot die, with most conflict scenarios boiling down to running in circles while the faux-griffon does his thing.<br><br>Unfortunately, this sloppy execution is a running theme throughout the game. Whilst the core ideas are solid, <i>The Last Guardian</i> is disappointingly rough time.<br><br>Whether this is due to the game's troubled development, I can't fully say. However, I can state that my playthrough was filled with equal parts joy and frustration. To put simply, Trico is an aggravating partner, who seemingly only listens to you half of the time. Whilst the developers have excused this as him acting like a real animal, I'm more inclined to believe that he is simply poorly programmed.<br><br>As such, the puzzles of this game mostly devolve to pressing R1 (the command button) and hoping Trico does something. There is no rhyme nor reason to the rules of the game world; no consistency between what Trico decides what it can and can't do - and this results in a truly frustrating time.<br><br>It's a shame, because there are some clever ideas (such as one puzzle the uses water physics), but they are few and far between.<br><br>The boy too, suffers from major problems. He stumbles and flops around way too much, as his gecko-like hands grab anything and everything, resulting in a jumble of flailing limbs - it's as if the game focused too much on the lavish animations and presentation, without taking the gameplay into account.<br><br>
