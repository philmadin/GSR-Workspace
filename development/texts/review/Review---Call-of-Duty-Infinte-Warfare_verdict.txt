Does the game deserve the backlash and social media outrage it received from the fan base? ABSOLUTELY NOT! This game is one of the best COD games i have played in years. While most fans want only "Boots to the Ground" type gameplay, this game actually serves as a both mechanised and boots to the ground style of game.<p><br></p><p>I would recommend playing this game before jumping on the hate bandwagon because it will surprise you. This game is an action packed ride with a roller-coaster of emotions towards the end.</p><p>If FPS is something you like, you're in for a treat.</p>
