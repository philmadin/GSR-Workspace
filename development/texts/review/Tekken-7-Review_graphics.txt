&lt;i&gt;Tekken 7&lt;/i&gt; has had a big focus on its graphics and fighter presentation, which obviously it is a great improvement on the other installments in the series and each fighter has their own unique look. While &lt;i&gt;Tekken 7&lt;/i&gt; has made so many improvements in its character design, I cannot help but notice that the game&#039;s customization suite is not as vast as in previous installments. It feels like a lot of the player&#039;s freedom to customize their rosters look has been taken away, and it would be okay if it were scaled back to make way for more features, but as of writing, I have not found any such addition that would call for this cutback. &lt;br&gt;
