GAMA is a beautiful place with a breathtaking backdrop. The snowy mountains that the resort and hospital are built on are a sight of their own, but the prettiest location may well be the gardens in the middle of the map.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the best views, I recommend the balcony of the high security private rooms, or starting the mission as a ninja on the hiking trail.&lt;/p&gt;
