&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The audio works hand in hand with the visuals to immerse you in its Fire Emblem splendour. The sound effects and music are familiar, but in a good way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Heroes is basically a love letter to the games that came before, but has gone just that little extra bit further. The game also features decent voice acting, giving us a greater depth to the characters from the older games in the franchise. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
