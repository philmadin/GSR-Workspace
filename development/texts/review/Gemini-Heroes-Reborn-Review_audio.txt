Unfortunately, the same praise cannot be directed towards the audio, which seems to consist of three tracks at most. The sound effects and ambient noise are fantastic, and all five powers are easily recognisable from their sounds. The audio sounds professional, but considering the game's overall quality, having only a few pieces of music is a disappointment at best.
