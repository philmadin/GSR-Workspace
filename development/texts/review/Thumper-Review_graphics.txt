<br>Welcome to the psychedelic hellscape that is <i>Thumper</i>. It simply looks great. Stellar particle effects, fluid animations, incredible views, undulating levels pulsing with neon light, <i>Thumper </i>truly is something to behold.<br><br><br>Unfortunately, within the excellent visuals, the gameplay itself is lost. Some of the particles obscure your vision, the lights distract you from your goal and the looming bosses are seldom glimpsed in favour of studiously gazing at the track ahead.<br><br><br><i>Thumper </i>really is one of the best looking games I've ever played but it's a textbook example of style over substance. In amongst the glorious visual effect there's a small silver beetle, cast aside in favour of an incredible spectacle. <br>
