&lt;p&gt;For Honor is aesthetically pleasing in all aspects. The melee combat is polished with hardly any stutters or drops in FPS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attention to design and detail behind the main warriors makes the game engaging and a delight to play.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;Although the environment is not it&#039;s strong suit, it is still very well designed. For a game set in medieval times, the colour palette is striking to say the least.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
