The music of Aven Colony is generic city builder music mixed with a mysterious&amp;nbsp; space sound, which doesn&#039;t add much to the game. Aven Colony has standard building noises, city noises and has minor voice acting which adds little to the game aside from providing plot exposition for the story mode.&lt;br&gt;
