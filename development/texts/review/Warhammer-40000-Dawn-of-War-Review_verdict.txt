If you like the Warhammer 40000 universe or strategy games in general, you'll probably enjoy <i>Dawn of War. </i>It was the first strategy game I ever bought and have since purchased more copies of it, and I regret none. It's undoubtedly a classic of the genre and holds up years after its release. Online or single player, <i>Dawn of War </i>will provide hours of fun and is well worth the relatively low price of admission.Â
