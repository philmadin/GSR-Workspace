Overall, &lt;i&gt;ARMS&lt;/i&gt; is a great new IP from Nintendo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though perhaps a little anemic in its offerings - especially when compared to other fighters on the market - it nevertheless holds a tonne of potential, especially since Nintendo have promised to continue supporting the game with free content.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regardless of the future, what we have &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt; is an addictive game that is deceptive in its simplicity, and is a genuine multiplayer joy. Hopefully, we have another &lt;i&gt;Splatoon&lt;/i&gt; on our hands, because &lt;i&gt;ARMS&lt;/i&gt; is certainly a fun new experience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Review copy provided by Nintendo Australia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
