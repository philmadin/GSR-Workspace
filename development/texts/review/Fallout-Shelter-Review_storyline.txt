<p class="MsoNormal">Not much of a storyline here, which is hardly a surprise considering the genre. Its does offer some charm, and funny dialogue at times, making it more personable than other games of its ilk. But with no main plot, or narrative, it's hardly the game's strong point.<o:p></o:p></p>
