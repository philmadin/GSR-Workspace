Likewise, audio is utterly amazing. Instead of a continuous soundtrack, &lt;i&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/i&gt; instead emphasises the sounds of nature when exploring, and the results are incredible. The Switch version in particular is mind-blowing, as Nintendo have touted its HD audio. Initially, I wasn&#039;t sure what to expect - until I actually found out that it mimics a surround set-up. Even on my tiny TV speakers, there were times when I actually thought the animal noises were coming from outside or behind me - which took my breath away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Actual music tracks are orchestrated and are typically epic, and the voice acting (a first for the series) was actually quite good. It&#039;s nothing that would dethrone Naughty Dog in terms of quality, but it works. Either way, speech is kept to a minimum, only playing in cutscenes - whether due to space or an artistic decision, I can&#039;t say. Still, I didn&#039;t mind; &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; things don&#039;t need to change!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
