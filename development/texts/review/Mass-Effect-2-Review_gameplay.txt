Something of a shift between this game and the first, <i>Mass Effect 2’s </i>combat and gameplay take a risky gamble and cut the fat.

With less junk to worry about, you are able to specialise your team to compensate for Shepard’s weaknesses and, surprise surprise, work together.The dialogue wheel is back as before but this time during some conversations Shepard can interrupt the exchange.
