Remaking past Zelda titles seems to be have been Nintendo’s fetish of late. But with <i>Ocarina of Time</i>, <i>Majora’s Mask</i>, <i>Wind Waker</i> and now <i>Twilight Princess</i> all lovingly remastered, it’s hard to complain. <i>Twilight Princess HD</i> is exactly what i’d hoped for. Mend the cracks whilst leaving the artwork in tact. All in all a good omen for the upcoming Legend of Zelda release.
