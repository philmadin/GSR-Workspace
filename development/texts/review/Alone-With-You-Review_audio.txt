Nearly every area has a dripping of water from stalactites, the wind from a storm outside, the whooshing of doors or the buzz of your shuttle jetting off across the Planet. Exaggerated but isolated, the sounds and eerie digitised music further press a loneliness.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The soundtrack itself, subtle, digital and haunting is kept as almost an undercurrent. Never intruding and with the mix of sci fi sound effects everything blends together very well. Instead of being "The Soundtrack" of the game, it comes across as purely natural to the world.Â </span></p>
