Overall, iO is a solid platformer that uses physics as a mechanic to provide you a challenge. It looks and sounds very clean with its simplistic style and the basic controls work great for it. It&#039;s not the type you&#039;d play for hours on end in front of a TV, but if you want a good challenge that makes you think, look no further.
