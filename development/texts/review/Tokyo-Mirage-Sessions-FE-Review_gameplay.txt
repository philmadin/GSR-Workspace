The gameplay of <i>Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE</i> will be very familiar to fans of Atlus' other franchises, <i>Shin Megami Tensei</i> and <i>Persona</i>. <br><br>Essentially a dungeon crawler with JRPG elements, it doesn't do anything drastically new, but what it does is very slick.<br><br>Every chapter has Itsuki and crew enter an Idolosphere, which is basically a big dungeon. Starting in your base of operations (the Fortuna Office), you can select your desired location on a map of Tokyo, and this will let you wander around a small portion of the 'real' world, chatting to characters, buying items, and undertaking favours. When you're ready, you then enter the Idolosphere, allowing you to engage in battle and forward the story.<br><br>Combat is standard turn-based fare, but is done with a flair and sleekness that makes it a lot more engaging than it's slower predecessors. Attacks are quick, and things are always moving, which creates a sense of action. 'Sessions' are special moves that can be used - and if they're effective against a certain enemy, then your partners join in in order to lay-on the hurt. These sessions are key in getting the most out of fighting, and successful use nets you items and yen for upgrades. Additionally, 'Ad-libs' stack on further (random) effects, and Dual Attacks can further extend sessions. All of these moves use magic points, which adds a nice element of strategy.<br><br>Outside of combat, you can upgrade your mirages in the Bloom Palace, which is a benign Idolosphere in the Fortuna building. You see, in dungeons, the FE characters become weapons (called 'Carnages'), and 'Carnage Unity' allows you to upgrade them via enemy parts. As you use these new carnages, you can unlock new abilities, before mastering them, and moving on to the next weapon. Similarly, 'Radiant Unity' are new performance arts, which are basically passive buffs that let you accrue bonuses.<br><br>Game Pad usage is minimal, but cute. The game pretends that the second screen is Itsuki's smartphone, and characters will message you - sometimes with important info, or just to shoot the breeze. It's a minor - albeit neat - addition that further immerses you in the game's world.<br>
