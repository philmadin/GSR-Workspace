In all, &lt;i&gt;Splatoon 2&lt;/i&gt; is another great game for the Switch&#039;s slowly-growing library.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though it isn&#039;t radically different for its Wii U forebear, it nevertheless hold a huge amount of promise - considering it will (like &lt;a href=&quot;http://gamesharkreviews.com/review.php?t=ARMS_Review&amp;amp;g=ARMS&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;ARMS&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) be treated with free DLC during its lifetime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An argument can be made about the game&#039;s lack of value for non-online players, but this is very much marketed as a title for competitive gamers. If you&#039;re a part of that audience, then &lt;i&gt;Splatoon 2&lt;/i&gt; has the potential to be Nintendo&#039;s answer to &lt;i&gt;Destiny&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Overwatch&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Review copy provided by Nintendo Australia.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
