Unnecessarily complicated, &lt;i&gt;Digimon World: Next Order&lt;/i&gt;, throws you straight into the deep end. There is so much happening that you aren&#039;t given a chance to understand what you just learned before having to move on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While at it&#039;s core, &lt;i&gt;Digimon World: Next Order &lt;/i&gt;is all about looking after your Digimon, making sure it rests, eats and trains. The game makes it way too complex with stat management and the random difficulty spikes that can halt your progress. Also the lack of control during battle becomes frustrating as you&#039;re missing the interaction that you want the most.&lt;br&gt;
