Hailing from 2012, <i>Spec Ops</i> has aged well for a game with a photo-realistic style. The models and animations are crisp and pleasant to look at, the effects are top notch and the way small visual cues are used to display the state of the characters still holds up. The most notable part of the visual spectacle is the sand, the way it flows as it cascades down from Dubaiâ€™s skyscrapers, the way it sprays as hundreds of bullets skip across its surface and the way it encompasses anyone unfortunate enough to become trapped in it. The game runs very well, especially for one that looks as good as it does. For a game made by a smaller team it outperforms many titles that are released even today and has little trouble competing with similar games on the market at the time.
