<br>Sound is minimal, but effective. The majority of the game is framed by the silence of the Nest, with Trico's whines and hisses filling the digital air. Action scenes get suitably more loud, with a selective orchestrated soundtrack making them much more impactful. I was also very fond of the main theme, and the fact that characters didn't speak English (instead, they converse in a 'Romanised Japanese', according to Fumito Ueda).<br><br>
