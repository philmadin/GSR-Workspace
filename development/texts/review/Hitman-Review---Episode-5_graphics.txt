The worst visuals in the game so far have been those of Episode 3&#039;s Marrakech. The colour scheme (which, besides lighting, is the only thing that really changes between episodes) was overwhelmingly sandy and colourless. But the difference between Marrakech and Colorado is that the former at least has some variety. The grey first impression of Colorado is exactly what the entire level looks like, even inside.&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the plus side, it suits the military environment well, and the level is by no means unattractive.&lt;/p&gt;
