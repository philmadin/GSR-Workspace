While there is no overt plot to be found within Unturned, there are two methods of storytelling. For one, stories are told through the environment with destroyed landmarks, collapsed bridges, graffiti scrawled across walls and more. While nothing is set in concrete, stumbling across one of these areas and piecing together what happened without the need for prompts or exposition is a refreshing change from the usual video game methods of plot delivery.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other &quot;storytelling&quot; method is those that the players themselves will create. Within an open world online game where the decisions you make are final, a number of strange encounters, exciting action sequences and more human moments than even the best AAA title can offer, are inevitable. I have waged wars against groups of bandits, looted and stolen from weaker players, built fortresses and been hunted by snipers. Everyone will have their own story to tell, their recounting of events that unfolded in a world were a dozen of the stories can be happening all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
