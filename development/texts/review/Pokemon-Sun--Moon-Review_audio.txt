<i><br>Game Freak</i> has created a fantastic soundtrack, capturing the peaceful melodies of island life and the cries of wild Pokemon in the background. One of the stranger tracks, yet somehow fitting, is Team Skull's theme. A mixture of rap and other noises, the theme sets the mood when they are on screen. These themes are well rounded and bring Alola to life.<br>
