&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;&quot;&gt;The question on everyone&#039;s lips before release was, &quot;what can we do?&quot;, and this sentiment still rings true for many players today. The player starts on a random planet where they must collect the resources necessary to power up their equipment and spaceship. Over the course of the first hour, they&#039;ll learn other languages one word at a time, find upgrades for their tools, explore new worlds, sell everything after running out of room, and meet alien creatures on supposedly undiscovered planets. Then the player will spend the next several hours asking, &quot;is this it?&quot; as they continue to endlessly collect resources, and repeatedly do the same things they did in the first hour.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;&quot;&gt;While there&#039;s something special about being the first person to discover, scan, and name a new species of plant or animal, it becomes much less special as you continue to discover very similar-looking things on subsequent planets. And while the greatest joy in the game is finding a tremendously beautiful planet with adorable wildlife, abundant flora, and flowing rivers, these moments are overshadowed by those spent on awful red and green radioactive wastelands with very few resources left, trying to find a cave to escape the storm of acid rain and the hostile sentinels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;&quot;&gt;The inescapable space combat is a rude awakening in a generally peaceful game, and a burden to participate in. Trading is this game&#039;s slightly fancy term for &quot;there are shops where you can buy and sell&quot;, and is only worthwhile because of extremely limited inventory space. And to add insult to injury, you need to make your way through at least part of the story to acquire a recipe for an Atlas Pass V1, which will let you into slightly more boxes and doors than not having one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;&quot;&gt;It&#039;s also worth mentioning that while the controls are initially difficult to learn on PS4, they are downright awful on PC.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;&quot;&gt;If, like Sean Murray and myself, you are seeking a game which lets you fly from the surface of one planet, through space, and be the first to land on another planet, make sure you grab this game during a sale. It does these essentials absolutely brilliantly, and sometimes it&#039;s just fun to try and discover 100% of what a planet has to offer. But if you&#039;re looking for anything more, and you&#039;re not absolutely obsessed with survival games, the first couple of hours of fun are not worth the repetition in every aspect of No Man&#039;s Sky. If this game was sold at an indie price as nothing but a survival-exploration game, it would do much better.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
