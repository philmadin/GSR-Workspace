The soundtrack of &lt;i&gt;Yooka-Laylee&lt;/i&gt; changes from world to world and sets the atmosphere for each world expertly, going from playful and inviting to tense and pressuring. The music changes depending on if you are running around the contained open worlds or battling one of the crafty bosses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is no voice acting in &lt;i&gt;Yooka-Laylee&lt;/i&gt;, instead Playtonic Games have decided to give every character their own sounds that they use in place of voices. Kartos (the god of ore) makes a &quot;Yoho ho ho yoho ya&quot; sound, those sounds are enough to get across what each character are saying, with a textbox providing the actual conversation.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;
