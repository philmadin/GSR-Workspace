Each world follows the same linear pattern, building and keeping your peeps alive. Set as a real-time strategy game, building your island up and keeping your peeps happy is crucial to getting the best time. Each island has &#039;goal times&#039; in which you have to work into to receive different achievement levels.&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no real &#039;story&#039; concept behind the game, other than keeping your peeps alive and fighting, which does make it sometimes lose appeal for me due to the very linear format of trying to achieve a perfect score and progressing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
