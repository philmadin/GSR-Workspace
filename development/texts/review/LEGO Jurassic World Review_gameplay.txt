Broken down into five quick stages for each film, LEGO Jurassic World focuses on creative puzzle solving to win hearts. If it is made of LEGO, it can be broken and rebuilt. The pieces collected can then be spent on any number of collectables: favourite characters, vehicles and amazing dinosaurs. <br />

All of the characters are solely unique and have abilities for different situations. Hunters are able to shoot targets, palaeontologists can dig and others can explore certain areas. With seamless switching, everyone has a part to play. Compared to previous LEGO games, Jurassic World is less concerned with combat and more focused on an overall experience. Fights (such as the one between the T-Rex and Velociraptors) become more memorable as a result, since they are rare.<br />
