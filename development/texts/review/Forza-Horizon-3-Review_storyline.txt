<p class="MsoNormal">Unlike the previous <i>Horizon</i> games where you race to become the fastest on the track, in <i>Horizon 3</i> you take the reins of the festival as a Horizon owner. Throughout the game different race types are unlocked like the usual point to point and circuit races which take good use of the new Australian location, weaving between Surfers sky rises and jumping the red sand dunes of the Outback. <br></p><p class="MsoNormal"><br><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">Where the horizon games differ from other offerings is the fantastic showcase races which will have you racing a train in the latest Mustang or jump a buggy while your Aussie grease monkey hangs from an Army chopper in a Jeep. Being the owner of the Horizon Festival, you are also able to create blueprints for races, letting you change time of day, weather and what types of cars to race. This is a great addition as it allows your friends to try out your specific circuits and conditions while keeping the same tracks fresh.Â <o:p></o:p></p>
