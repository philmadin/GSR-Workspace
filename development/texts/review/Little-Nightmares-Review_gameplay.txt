The gameplay of &lt;i&gt;Little Nightmares&lt;/i&gt; works great with the story, encouraging exploration of the levels in order to not only to find your way to freedom but uncover more on the story of what &quot;The Maw&quot; really is. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only problem I have with &lt;i&gt;Little Nightmares&#039;&lt;/i&gt; gameplay is that sometimes because of the fixed camera, running from enemies can lead to death when you slide into a wall instead of the hole you were aiming for.&lt;br&gt;
