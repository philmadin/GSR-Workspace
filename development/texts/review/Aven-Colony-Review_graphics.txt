Aven Colony&#039;s graphics are limited by the type of game that it is, but it does everything that it sets out it do; the buildings look great, the detail in the world was amazing in my opinion because most city builder games don&#039;t bother with how the world looks they just focus on the buildings themselves. The only fallback of Aven Colony is that when using the 8x speed the frame rate will drop, for me this occurred while my colony was at 1000 colonist but it resolved itself within seconds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
