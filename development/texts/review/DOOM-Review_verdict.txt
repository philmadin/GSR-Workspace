<p>I donâ€™t think many people expected this DOOM to be so well handled. After a troubling development schedule it seemed at one stage that we may never again see such an iconic series resurrected to the standard that it deserved. And yet here we are. DOOM marks a triumphant return for id Software and the series as a whole and I look forward to what comes next for our beloved Doom Guy.</p>
