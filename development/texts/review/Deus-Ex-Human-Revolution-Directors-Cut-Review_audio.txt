Deus Ex: Human Revolution features a suitably synthetic audio track, composed by Michael McCann, the man behind the X-Com reboot and the upcoming Mankind Divided. The score is both epic and reserved, featuring as both a background track in the city hubs and as a story telling device during some of the more immense moments. The Icarus track in particular quickly becoming a fan favourite. Add to this a plethora of in game sound effects that add to the atmosphere, from sliding doors to alarms to the way different augments sound, the player is assaulted with what is quite possibly one of the best sounding games of recent years. The only flaw with the sound design is one which many shooters fall prey to, the shooting itself. The guns sound small and weak, the shots cut short, the audio failing to capture even the immense blast of the shotgun. Deus Ex is not the first game to fall short in this area and it will not be the last.
