This may sound crazy but the &lt;i&gt;Omega Collection&lt;/i&gt; feels better than &lt;i&gt;WipEout&lt;/i&gt; has ever felt before. The cars handle like a dream and the tracks themselves are immensely challenging.&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will take some time to learn the ins and outs of each arena but once you are knowledgeable about each track it won&#039;t take long before you are rabidly trying to beat the AI&#039;s high scores or your own personal bests.&lt;/p&gt;
