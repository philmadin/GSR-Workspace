Dawn of War II steps away from the more traditional RTS staples, instead of becoming a different beast entirely. Gone are the days of base building, instead replaced by a sole command structure from which all units are built. Each unit can acquire it&#039;s own weapons, allowing them to focus on specific areas such as area control, anti-infantry or anti-vehicle. These changes are nothing major and while they help to streamline matches, they also hold back on the scale.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six, maybe eight squads at any given time, ranging in size from three to six units. And that&#039;s if you want infantry. Want to blast your way around the battle with vehicles? Well, you&#039;re out of luck. They&#039;re available but it&#039;s almost impossible to establish a good mix of infantry and armour. While Dawn of War had separate population pools for both factors of an army, Dawn of War II has a shared one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worst part is that the individual races don&#039;t differ as much as they did, the smaller unit pool having a stronger focus on counter units. This means that the strategy for every race is pretty much the same. Rush early with cheap units or hold out until you have some hard hitters. The Space Marines are still solid all-rounders, the Eldar are still fragile in melee though much less so now, and Orks are still meat shields with big axes. The new race, the Tyranids, play like Starcraft&#039;s Zerg, relying either on massed melee units or a small number of more powerful organic weapons. Unfortunately, outside of design, everyone is pretty much the same.&lt;/p&gt;
