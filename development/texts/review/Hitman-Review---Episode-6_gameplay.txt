Agent 47 is tasked with killing the director of the ICA, Erich Soders, and Providence member Yuki Yamazaki. There are multiple ways to go about this, and some of the coolest Opportunities yet. Soders is in surgery for a heart transplant, which leaves him open for the surgery to be hijacked, or for the right-sided heart he&#039;s relying on to be destroyed.&amp;nbsp;And there are so many more ways to skin the metaphorical cats in episode 6, with saunas, heart attacks, and cable cars.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet, for the most part, there are very few places you can go without a disguise or disposable scrambler, and weapons or disguises are hard to get at first. It certainly steps up the difficulty and increases creativity, but that doesn&#039;t change the fact that the first few minutes are mostly spent waiting for someone to move to the right spot.&lt;/p&gt;
