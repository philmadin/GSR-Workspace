<i><br>Clustertruck </i>is a platformer with a unique twist, every single platform moves. The player must traverse a chaotic highway of trucks, and touching <i>only</i> trucks. To touch anything that isn't a truck will result in a game over.<p><br></p><p>To aid you in this endeavour, you will be given access to numerous abilities and upgrades, each unlocked through the points gained by completing levels. These include a jetpack, which allows you to fly for short periods of time, a time slowing ability and a grappling hook, which does as you would imagine.</p><p><br></p><p>It controls well, as any platformer should, with tight movement, both in the air and on the trucks, and the items and upgrades ensure different ways to play. While the game itself is enjoyable, it is rather short and has a high price tag, $15USD, for a game with not a whole lot of content.</p>
