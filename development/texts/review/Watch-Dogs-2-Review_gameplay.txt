<br>Gameplay much like the last game is where <i>Watch_Dogs 2</i> separates itself from other open world offerings. Expanding on the one button hacking mechanic, you now hold down the left bumper on your controller, which gives the player up to 4 options to choose from. If you're in a car chase and want to cause chaos, hack the police car to suddenly turn left into his co-workers.<p><br></p><p>This small addition helps within more stealth orientated missions, allowing you to create a distraction for near a guard all for the nearest fuse box to explode and put him into a electricity-fuelled coma. It's also great to see the driving mechanics improved from the previous game, but Ubisoft are still yet to find the right balance in the arcade handling system. Make sure to slide a car right next to a group of pedestrians, the reactions are fantastic.</p><p><br></p><p>Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to properly test the online components of the game as the servers have been offline, which feature of players dropping into your world and trying to hack your information. When stable, it offers up a good diversion from the main story missions allowing you to interact with other players and roam the streets together.</p>
