&lt;i&gt;DiRT 4&lt;/i&gt; continues to showcase the driving mechanics and physics that have set the series apart from all other racing games in the genre. Specifically, smooth controls, a detailed tutorial that teaches the player all the ins and outs of how to craft the perfect race no matter the type, and the in-game co-driver that alerts you of the track ahead of time so that you don&#039;t go from a rally car to a crashing airplane. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;DiRT 4&lt;/i&gt; also features a Multiplayer mode, where you can test your skills against other players across the world, and the Joyride mode where you can just drive around the &lt;i&gt;DiRTFISH&lt;/i&gt; academy and make up your own fun. In a first for the series, &lt;i&gt;DiRT 4&lt;/i&gt; also gives players the chance to drive a randomly generated track in Freeplay mode; and through driving this track, you can create your own rally stage for you and your friends to race against each other. All this adds up to this being possibly the best racing game of the last five years.&lt;br&gt;
