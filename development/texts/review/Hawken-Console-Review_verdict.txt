<i>Hawken</i> is a mech-tonne of light hearted fun, but consoles clearly weren’t its original home. The chance to experience it is appreciated but there are some clear inconsistencies with the core framework. That said the gameplay and feel of the combat is well executed and frankly, for the potential total cost of nothing, it’s hard to complain.
