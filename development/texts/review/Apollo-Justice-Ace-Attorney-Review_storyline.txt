<i>Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney</i>&nbsp;is set seven years after <i>Trials &amp; Tribulations</i>. The protagonist is a 22-year-old lawyer named Apollo Justice. You're introduced to him just before his first case where he's defending a poker played named Phoenix Wright. After this case, Phoenix hires Apollo at the Wright Talent Agency where he's introduced to Phoenix's teenage daughter, Trucy Wright.<p><br></p><p>Like every other <i>Ace Attorney</i>&nbsp;game, the story is where the real action of the game is. <i>Apollo Justice</i>&nbsp;is no exception, mostly. Through the game, the story sets up the need for a revolution within the Court System. But while the payoff is there in the end, the cases by themselves let the game down.</p><p><br></p><p>The second case is where you're first introduced to a lot of the characters and can feel a little all disjointed at times.</p><p><br></p><p>The third case develops the character of the this game's prosecutor, Klavier Gavin, well but fails with the basic justification for the defendant's arrest.</p><p><br></p><p>The fou<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">rth case is arguably the best out of the lot. But the set up with the MASON System feels weird. This is because you act as a jury member and play through the investigation segments as if it's a game.</span></p>
