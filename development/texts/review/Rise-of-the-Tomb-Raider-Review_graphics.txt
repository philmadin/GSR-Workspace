&lt;p&gt;Crystal Dynamics once again produces something of the highest order. The environment is flawless and the snow effects contribute a lot towards it as the game has a snowy backdrop. Visuals are crisp and the cutscenes are a significant improvement from the last title. There is a little bit of frame drop, stuttering and tearing once in a while but nothing which threatens to become serious.&lt;/p&gt;
