The biggest change between the base game and its expansion is the introduction of the Imperial Guard. With relatively weak standard infantry that are surprisingly effective en masse and a selection of specialised units, the guard don't fare too well on a man-to-man basis with every other race outclassing them in at least one way. Where they shine however, is with their vehicles. From the two-legged Sentinels to the mighty Leman Russ tank and the long ranged Basilisk. The guard have a focus on moving quickly and striking fast, but are also handy in defence, something sorely lacking in the base game.<p><br></p><p><br><p>Outside of the Imperial Guard, the other changes are minor adjustments to unit weapons and counters but overall there's not a whole lot of difference. Each however race gets a new unit such as the Space Marine's chaplain, a zealous warrior who can more than hold his own, to the Khorne Berserkers of Chaos, axe wielding mad men who are willing to spill blood for their dark gods. These new units fill in a number of empty spaces and make the game even better.</p></p>
