&lt;i&gt;Speedrunners &lt;/i&gt;has a sixties camp comic art style. The art style really makes&amp;nbsp;it stand out from other side-scrolling race games and coupled with the gameplay and music, it really nails the tone the game aims for.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The character design appears as though the game was formed around the character names - and the design followed. The characters are; Speedrunner, Hothead, Unic, and Gil. The player can tell them apart immediately upon first glance. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The level design in &lt;i&gt;Speedrunners &lt;/i&gt;is impressive, with each track boasting a theme, be it a power plant or a theme park. The backgrounds of the tracks are as unique as the tracks themselves, and no two stages are the same. This ensures that the player would never get bored, as the variability in the tracks will keep them on their toes. &lt;br&gt;
