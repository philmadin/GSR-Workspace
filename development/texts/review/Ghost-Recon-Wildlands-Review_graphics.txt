&lt;p&gt;The beauty of &lt;i&gt;Wildlands&lt;/i&gt; is that players can customise almost every aspect of the HUD. The quality of forestation textures and weather animations such as lightning are superb. Structures are very much repetitive in nature, but there are distinguishing factors to most locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although most of &lt;i&gt;Wildlands&lt;/i&gt; is a gorgeous sight to behold, it can be hard optimising the default settings to visually see properly in dark areas - while retaining realistic lighting (tested on PlayStation 4, UHD).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
