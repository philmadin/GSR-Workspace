There is an ongoing war for the control of the solar system between the Settlement Defence Front (SDF ) and the United Nations Space Alliance (UNSA).<p><br></p><p>The game puts you in the shoes of Nick Reyes, a UNSA pilot who becomes the leader of 'The Retribution', a UNSA warship, when the captain die leaving him the highest ranking official on board. This exposes Reyes as a vulnerable leader who puts safety of his team first rather than completing the mission at hand. The SDF leader and commander of the warship 'Olympus Mons', Admiral Salen Kotch will do anything to bring UNSA to it's knees and take over the Earth. Infinite Warfare has several likeable NPC's like Reyes' wingman Nora Salter and his Robot sidekick E3N Ethan who help out in Reyes' plans to defeat the SDF.&nbsp;</p><p>The game allows you to choose your own missions which are of varying difficulty. Each mission has a different objective located on a different planet and tells you how it would help you in taking town the SDF which makes the story feel a lot more genuine and not just a mindless shooter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
