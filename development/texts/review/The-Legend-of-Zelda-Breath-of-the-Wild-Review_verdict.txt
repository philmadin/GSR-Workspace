Overall, &lt;i&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;/i&gt; is one of the best games I have ever played. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whether it dethrones &lt;i&gt;Ocarina of Time&lt;/i&gt; (my personal favourite of all-time) is something I can only say after further reflection, but it most definitely at least matches it, in my opinion. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#039;s a game that represents Nintendo - and the medium itself - at its very best, and proves that unforgettable gaming experiences aren&#039;t beholden to state-of-the-art hardware. It&#039;s the ultimate proof of how smart programming trumps raw power, and Zelda&#039;s continues to place as one of gaming&#039;s most revered IP.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A true must buy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
