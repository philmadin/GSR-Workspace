&lt;p&gt;An absolute highlight of this game, the sound and music are some of the best in gaming history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dragon Quest &lt;/i&gt;has never been a slouch in the music SFX department, but &lt;i&gt;Journey of the Cursed King &lt;/i&gt;is perhaps the best in the entire series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Koichi Sugiyama is in top form, with amazingly evocative and catchy music that will &lt;i&gt;never &lt;/i&gt;leave your head. I&#039;m particularly fond of the overworld and battle themes, but practically every facet of the score is memorable. Sadly, the full orchestral tunes of the western PS2&amp;nbsp;version have been replaced by MIDI arrangement of the Japanese original (which has nothing to do with the 3DS, but rather rights issues). Thankfully, the end result isn&#039;t too different - and if you&#039;re new to the game, you won&#039;t even notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voice acting comes into the franchise for the first time, and &lt;i&gt;DQVIII&lt;/i&gt; absolutely nails it. The localisation suffers none of the issues that comes with Japanese games, with the less-realistic and more optimistic world of Yuji Horii matching perfectly with the hilarious cast that portrays a wide array of dialects and accents. Even 13 years after its original release, the game still blows away more contemporary translations, like &lt;i&gt;Final Fantasy XV&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
