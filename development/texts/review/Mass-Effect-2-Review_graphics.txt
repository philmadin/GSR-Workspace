Particularly at the time of release, <i>Mass Effect 2</i> was at the head of the pack. Issues that plagued the first game appeared resolved with the only bugs pertaining to file corruption and the like. With onlyÂ six years passing since release, the game is still (perhaps unfortunately) superior to some titles today.But the style is different. Shepard is now in the seedy side of the galaxy and visiting places like Omega, a mining station inside an Asteroid field, express this. Darker, grubbier, corrupt worlds await, instead of the clean, business world of the first game.
