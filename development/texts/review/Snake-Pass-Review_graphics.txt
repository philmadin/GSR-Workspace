&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Snake Pass&lt;/i&gt; was built in the Unreal 4 engine, therefore it looks very clean. It likely looks more detailed on the Play Station 4 Pro and other systems as well, but it still looks good on the Switch. Noodle&#039;s scales look smooth and scaly, and Doodle&#039;s feathers are iridescent and shiny. The water, grass, and trees are all pleasing to look at. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game overall is a bit less detailed when it&#039;s in tablet mode on the &lt;i&gt;Switch,&lt;/i&gt; but it&#039;s only slight and doesn&#039;t diminish the experience. Of course, it&#039;ll look better when on a large TV and the Switch is docked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
