<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: start;">Quadrilateral Cowboy is both excellent and frustrating at the same time. Its gameplay is top notch, the controls responsive and the hacking enjoyable but it is let down by a non-existent story and a mixed art style. At times it feels like nothing more than a really good proof of concept and at others it seems like it wants to spread its wings and soar on a narrative that just isn't there for whatever reason, be it time or budget constraints or some other factor. As game is entertaining and doesn't overstay it's welcome, it's worth checking out, just as long as you know what you're getting into.</p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: start;"><br></p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: start;"><br></p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: start;">Quadrilateral Cowboy is available on Steam for $19.99.</p>
