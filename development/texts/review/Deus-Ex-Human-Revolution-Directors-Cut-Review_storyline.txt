Human Revolution takes place a number of years before the original Deus Ex, telling the story of Adam Jensen, a once ordinary man who became an augmented individual after a devastating attack. He is soon dispatched by his employer to unearth a conspiracy that winds its way through all aspects of society, from the street dwellers to governing officials. The story telling is, for the most part, well handled with twists and turns taking the player by surprise and certain choices having very real consequences. Various side quests add depth and intrigue to the world,each telling their own story in a unique manner. Unfortunately the game does take some time to develop a truly riveting story and the first few levels are somewhat dull in comparison but overall Human Revolution tells an interesting and varied tale of pseudo-racism and civil unrest.
