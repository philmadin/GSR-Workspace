<i>Batman: Realm of Shadows</i> is not a perfect <i>Batman</i> experience but it does lay the foundation for a compelling and unique tale, worthy of the character. I get the feeling that every decision I make will gradually decide the fate of Gotham City, its inhabitants, and of course, its notorious villains. I came in with reservations about whether I would purchase the season pass but after completing <i>ROS</i>, it's safe to say that I'll be hoping in that Batmobile and driving into rest of that sweet, dark night.
