The audio follows in the vein to the art style and is kept to a minimum with basically no music and no voice acting, other than the robotic chanting of "super, hot" at the end of every level. The drawn out tinkling of broken glass effect as enemies shatter is nice, and the usual combat effects like weapons firing and melee combat are decent. Strangely, it seems to be the in game menu that has the most interesting sound design, with retro computer beeps and bops accompanying the samples of tied old had drives whirring away.
