&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;For Honor &lt;/i&gt;is a &amp;nbsp;melee combat game second to none. Although the story feels like a glorified tutorial, it&#039;s not that significant for a game which has multiplayer as its bread and butter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&#039;re looking for a more complete single player experience with a good storyline, its better to look elsewhere.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you&#039;re &amp;nbsp;looking for rewarding fights leading up to badass executions, have the patience to master warriors and have a stable internet connection, For Honor is the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
