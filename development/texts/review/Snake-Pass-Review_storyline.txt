&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Snake Pass&lt;/i&gt;, you play as a snake named Noodle. He&#039;s awoken one day by his hummingbird friend, Doodle, who tells him someone&#039;s attacking some &#039;gates&#039; in their world. Your job from there is to make your way through various levels, find out who&#039;s been attacking the gates, and stop them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Snake Pass&lt;/i&gt; definitely has a bare bones plot, but since it&#039;s a puzzle-platformer, the story&#039;s not the thing drawing you in. The characters have personality, and Noodle&#039;s lazy aura has a certain charm to it. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
