The soundtrack is exactly what you&#039;d hope for in a futuristic racer. Frenetic and exhilarating. When you are flying sporadically through the air there is nothing better than hearing music that matches the chaotic nature of the races themselves. Several of the tracks are tasteful remasters of songs in previous games while some are completely untouched and left to shine in all their glory.
