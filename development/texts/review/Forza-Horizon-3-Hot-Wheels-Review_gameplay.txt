&lt;p&gt;The&lt;i&gt; Hot Wheels DLC &lt;/i&gt;plays exactly the same as &lt;i&gt;Horizon 3&lt;/i&gt; except now, we&#039;re in Hot Wheels land. Everything from the iconic orange tracks, loops, banked turns, boost zones, outlandish cars and even robotic dinosaurs has made its way into one of the best racing games ever made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You read that right - we now have stunts and boost zones! The &lt;i&gt;Horizon &lt;/i&gt;universe has always been about providing an experience we could only dream of, and show me one kid who played with Hot Wheels that didn&#039;t want to bring that to life. But don&#039;t think that it&#039;s turned Forza into a ridiculous fantasy arcade racer; it&#039;s incredible just how natural and realistic it still feels.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The physics fully hold up as you race around these tracks. Cars slow down and handle as you&#039;d expect if such this was actually possible. Hit a boost section wrong and you&#039;ll struggle to maintain control as you land if you land at all. If you don&#039;t carry enough speed through the stunt sections you&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;will &lt;/i&gt;fall off. Thankfully the new content paces the class requirements and tracks in such a way that if you fail, it&#039;s your fault, not the cars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The usual &lt;i&gt;Horizon &lt;/i&gt;items are here too: boards to smash, bucket lists to complete, drift and speed zones to master and even another barn find. To complement the new track design though we&#039;re given a new tool called &#039;Stunt Swap&#039;. As the name suggests, it offers you the option to swap out feature stunts along a track as you see fit, which adds some great replayability to the tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
