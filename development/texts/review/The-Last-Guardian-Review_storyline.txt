<br>Much like its PS2 predecessors, the story of <i>The Last Guardian</i> is intriguingly minimalist, with vague symbolism and major events told mostly through gameplay. As such, it's hard to talk at length about the narrative, since it's so intrinsically tied to the core experience.<br><br>The game begins when a nameless boy awakens in a dank pit. Baffled by mysterious tattoos that cover his body, he also finds a large creature chained and wounded. Recognising it as a man-eating 'Trico', he nevertheless frees it, before they slowly form a friendship.<br><br>With barely a word spoken, the two warily work together to escape their confines, which turns out to be an ancient fortress known as the 'Nest'. Along the way, the bond between the boy and Trico gets stronger, as they discover the sinister background of their captors.<br><br>With a loose connection to the previous Team ICO games, the the 15 hour (or so) tale is laden with evocative imagery that raises a tonne of theories regarding their meaning, as well as truly emotional moments that bought a tear or two to my eye. <br><br>Of course, such an insular experience won't be for everyone, though some narrative context from an adult version of the main character helps in alleviating the vagueness of everything.<br><br>
