One of Destiny’s biggest strengths has always been its gameplay and The Taken King is no exception.

Another newish feature is an enemy race called The Taken, which is a possessed version of the current enemies – not particularly an innovative move from Bungie. Difficult and obnoxious, The Taken can be very frustrating additions to an already crowded environment.
