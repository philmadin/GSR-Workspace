&lt;i&gt;DiRT 4&lt;/i&gt; does a lot of things right when it comes to the gameplay and overall feel of the game, arguably perfectly. I may be spouting a lot of love for the game, but that is because &lt;i&gt;DiRT 4&lt;/i&gt; is just leagues ahead of others in this genre.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything from driving to the team customization is improved on in &lt;i&gt;DiRT 4.&lt;/i&gt; I suggest that anyone who is into racing games should definitely give this game a try because I feel this is the best racing game of the last five years. &lt;br&gt;
