<i>Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE</i> places you in the shoes of Itsuki Aoi, a school student in Tokyo who becomes embroiled in an otherworldly war that is being secretly waged throughout the city.<br><br>The game begins with him visiting his best friend, Tsubasa Oribe, as she enters an audition to become the next idol sensation. However, she is soon kidnapped, and taken to an alternate dimension known as the 'Idolosphere', before she is harvested for a mysterious spirit energy called 'Performa'. Bristling toward such shenanigans, Itsuki gives chase, and he himself uses his newfound performa to save an enslaved 'Mirage' known as Chrom (the very same from <i>Fire Emblem</i>).<br><br>Essentially a ghost with no memories of his past, Chrom returns the teen's kindness by helping him liberate Tsubasa - along with her own FE Mirage, a warrior named Caeda. The four then escape the Idolosphere with their third friend, Touma, and <i>his</i> Mirage, Cain. Touma reveals that he is in fact a 'Mirage Master', a secret warrior battling against the evil Mirages that are slowly encroaching Tokyo.<br><br>Taking them to his base in Fortuna Offices, Touma introduces them to the squad's leader, a talent agent named Maiko. She tells Itsuki and Tsubasa about the Mirages' lust for performa, which is the spirit energy created by humans when they engage in the arts (singing, acting, etc.). As such, Mirage Masters not only need to be fearsome warriors, but famous idols that develop their performa.<br><br>It's certainly an intriguing set-up, and as you'd probably expect, things only get more engaging and unexpected as the story progresses. The campaign is split into chapters, with 'intermissions' in between that basically deal with world-building side-quests. Honestly, I had reservations about the whole thing coming in, but I applaud Atlus for delivering a unique set-up that is anything but ordinary.<br>
