<i>Apollo Justice</i> sticks with the same basic gameplay as the other games. During the investigation, you talk to various people related to the case as well as examine crime scenes to pick up clues and evidence. Then, you use these in court to point out contradictions in the witness's testimonies.<p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p>While Psyche Locks make a brief reappearance in this game, the featured element of gameplay this time round is Apollo's 'Perceive' ability. Through his bracelet and kinetic vision, he's able to spot whenever a person is lying via a nervous twitch. It can be difficult at times to spot this 'tell', but there are no penalties so you can try as many times as you wish.</p><p></p><p></p>
