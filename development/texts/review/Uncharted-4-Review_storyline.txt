<i>Uncharted 4</i> is the final game in the series that follows adventurer Nathan Drake. Nathan has settled  uneasily into a normal life: a house in the suburbs and a typical everyday job. When his brother Sam arrives, Nathan is drawn into new dilemmas as he helps him hunt for pirate treasure.<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;" align="LEFT"><i style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">Uncharted 4</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> plays out like an action movie. It has a dramatic opening, flashbacks and plenty of intense moments. However, the story has pacing issues, with some chapters dragging out unnecessarily and others feeling too brief in contrast to what is happening. The slower chapters show how Nathan Drake has grown as a character. What was once important to him, treasure hunting, is now secondary to his family and their safety. Naughty Dog fleshes out this idea over the entire game by contrasting Nathan to his brother Sam. It may include the typical action movie cliches but it delivers everything expected from an Uncharted game.</span></p>
