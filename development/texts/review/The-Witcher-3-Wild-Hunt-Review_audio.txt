The audio in the game is magnificent. The sounds of the wind whistling through the trees, waves crashing against the rocks or of your blade slicing through a monster’s chest are matched by a majestic soundtrack always lingering to make you feel as epic as possible. Dialogue is well acted albeit repetitive in places, but considering how much content is packed in, it’s only to be expected.
