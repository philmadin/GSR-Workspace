One doesn’t even need to read the surprisingly entertaining developer’s commentary to realise how much effort went into making Ninja look as good as it does. Layers upon layers of background invite the player into this strange cartoon land of ancient clans in modern times, and some of the smoothest animations in video games today bring the player right into the silent shoes of the ninja.<br />

As one commentary bubble points out, the difference in animation between the guards – with stiffer movement – and the smooth flowing ninja represents the characters well; but it goes much further than that. Designers and developers using the grid-based tool from the Klei game Shank somehow were able to create these intricate worlds that never look like tiles on a grid. The lighting is apparent, giving plenty of visibility while communicating complete darkness. Mark Of The Ninja really is wonderful to look at.
