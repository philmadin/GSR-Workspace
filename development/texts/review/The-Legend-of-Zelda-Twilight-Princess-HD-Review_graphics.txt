<i>Twilight Princess</i> was originally fuzzy and blurry with hardware limitations clearly hampering the artistic view of the team. HD looks like someone whipped out the sandpaper and Windex to allow the sleeker, more defined interior to be set free. Even basic visuals such as grass, whilst still a flat expanse, show clear differentiation between the blades.<br><br>However, the graphical jump is not as intense as many other high definition re-releases. Unlike say, Halo, where the difference between old and new was extensive, <i>Twilight Princess</i> is still fairly close to its original form. It just looks a damn site better.
