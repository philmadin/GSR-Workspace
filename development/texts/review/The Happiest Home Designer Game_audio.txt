The music in this game perfectly sets the atmosphere for wherever you are, whether you’re just chillin’ in Nook’s Homes or out designing a home. It’s the perfect background music but one of the catchiest pieces plays whenever you’re seeing a completed house/facility.  <br />

K.K Slider’s entire catalogue can be unlocked through villagers’ which you can groove out to wherever you can put a stereo. Perhaps one of the cutest parts is if you’re playing one of K.K’s songs, you can put a villager in front of a microphone and they’ll sing along. <br />
