The soundtrack of &lt;i&gt;Troll and I &lt;/i&gt;is the highlight of the game. The ambient music really sets the tone for each stage; combat music brings the duller parts of the game to life and engages the player to fight to the death. The voice acting is sporadic; some characters have lines delivered with a purpose making the scene engaging for the player, yet Otto&#039;s jarring accent travels across Europe over the course of the game.&lt;br&gt;
