Just like previous Project Zero/Fatal Frame games, your main source of defence is the Camera Obscura, an old snapper that can defeat ghosts by taking their picture.<br />
<br />
Thanks to the Wii U’s Game Pad, this gameplay mechanic has received a fantastic lick of paint. Using the controller like a real lens, pressing the ‘X’ button and holding the pad up to the TV simulates the actual Camera Obscura, and moving it enables you to get in the optimal view of your spectral attackers.<br />
<br />
Taking pictures is surprisingly varied in execution. When in view, ghosts have weak points that become exposed, and the amount of damage done is dependent on how many points are in the shot, how close the wraith is, and what position it is in (for example, shots are more effective just as they’re attacking). It’s a system based on risk and reward, and it’s very well done.<br />
What are not well done are the tank controls, which are frustrating when trying to avoid danger. Walking is too slow, and running is too fast, so I found myself constantly flitting between the two modes.<br />
<br />
Still, a nice new touch is the ‘wetness’ meter, which makes your character more vulnerable to unwanted undead attention the more soaked they get.<br />
