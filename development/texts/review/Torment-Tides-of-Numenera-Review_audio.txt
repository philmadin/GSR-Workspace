&lt;p&gt;Of course, for any RPG to keep you engrossed, scene setting audio is a must. Torment&#039;s soundtrack does just this. Pretty much every aspect of the game has a different audio track playing to suit the environment you&#039;re in.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voice acting is kept to a minimum, unless you interact with an important NPC who will let off a few sentences before going back to non verbal, text communication. Unfortunately there&#039;s not really an option to skip these random lectures which can be annoying if you&#039;re a fast reader and have skipped through most of the written dialogue before the NPC has finished talking.&lt;/p&gt;
