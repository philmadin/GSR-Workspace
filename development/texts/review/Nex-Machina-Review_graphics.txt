In a word, awful. Visual diarrhea. Lights flash, lasers fly, the muddy textures are indistinguishable and there&#039;s so much going on that it quickly becomes impossible to determine exactly what is happening. Add to this the fact that the game runs at about 15 fps, approximately 45 lower than it should, and you have a recipe for disaster.
