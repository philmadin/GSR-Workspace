Leo’s Fortune is both beautiful and graceful with each act having it’s own theme from forests to snow. Leo’s Eastern European accent and thick, bushy moustache are easily identifiable whilst locales are lovingly designed with only minor occasions of repetition.<br />

Leo and his furry buddies are fluffy, cute and very reminiscent of the Sootballs from Studio Ghibli’s Spirited Away. Leo puffs out and wobbles organically, a pleasing touch to a simple character.<br />

There is no violence here, the worst you can witness being some spiky objects that will simply cause Leo to express his discomfort upon contact, before resetting to one of the many checkpoints.
