The beauty of this game is the variety of characters available. There are 21 different heroes, each with their own play-style and role. The four roles are: offence, defence, support and tank. Each hero has a skill level, indicating how easy they are to use.Mastering them is the key to winning. Switching characters is encouraged as the opposing team is constantly evolving their strategy based on the objective of the match. Being able to fill multiple roles means that you understand the enemy and can destroy them.<br><br>While playing, I experienced no lag or disconnects which was surprising for a beta. This is promising for a game that relies on quick reflexes and a decent connection.<i> Overwatch</i> may only have three game modes, but, the amount of maps available and their layouts changed the pace of each mode considerably. Hopefully, in the future,more modes will be added to prevent the game from becoming stale. The control scheme is great and can be remapped for every character, an added bonus. <i>Blizzard</i> also needs to be mindful when balancing characters. They must not rush on player feedback and adjust as they see fit for the game.
