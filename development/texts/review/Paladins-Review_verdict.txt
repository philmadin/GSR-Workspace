&lt;i&gt;Paladins&lt;/i&gt; is undoubtedly one of the best free to play games and an incredible achievement in the multiplayer shooter category. However, the developers&#039; lack of focus on platform specific balancing has made this game increasingly frustrating to play.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That being said, it is still undoubtedly fun and if you are uncertain about MOBA shooters, &lt;i&gt;Paladins&lt;/i&gt; is a good place to start. It might not have an extensive number of game modes or a long list of maps but it makes up for it with exhilarating, team-based action to keep you engrossed for hours on end.&lt;/p&gt;
