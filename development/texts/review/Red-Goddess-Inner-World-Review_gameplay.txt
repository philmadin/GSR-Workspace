Attempting to wrestle with the story is just a warm up for the constant battle with the controls. Controller support is added and while I found a joypad easier, the mapping was confusing. <br />

Aside from that, the Movement wasn’t fluid at all; with invisible walls, poorly placed platforms and clunky jumping mechanics making mobility feel like a chore. The easy puzzles are few and the constant backtracking is pointless and draining. <br />

While the game drip feeds a variety of mechanics, none of them are very game-changing until the last 30 minutes. Red Goddess presents a large variety of enemies but it fails to feel unique and if it weren’t for the slight enjoyment I found in combat, I would have dropped this game after the first hour. <br />

Combat features a unique colour code system and an interesting possess mechanic to spice up the mix. Despite this, issues such as falling through platforms and terrain clipping didn’t make my experience very fun.
