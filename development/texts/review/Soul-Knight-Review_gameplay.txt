&lt;p&gt;Gameplay in &lt;i&gt;Soul Knight &lt;/i&gt;is fantastic. Set in randomly generated dungeons, you move from room to room clearing enemies and collecting loot. A play through consists of five worlds with five levels each, and each world culminates in a rather tricky boss fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You control a single character that starts off with a basic weapon, and can carry two at once, swapping between them whenever needed. The 120+ weapons themselves are glorious, from basic pistols, bows, staffs and rifles up to charge and beam weapons, with some novelty weapons like laser fish thrown in for good measure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game features an auto-aim mechanic that does a good job at simplifying things for a mobile device, but don&#039;t think for a second that this is a walk in the park. You are constantly dodging attacks and charging enemies while taking cover to let your shield recharge, and with the amount of action on screen at a time (especially in the boss fights) that can get incredibly tricky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only real detractor for me is the lack of variety and information. While everything is randomly generated each time there seems to only be a limited pool of resources, meaning that things can get a bit &#039;samey&#039; after multiple play throughs. Thankfully, the variety in weapons does compensate for that; however there is very little information for the weapons themselves. This turns it into a bit of a trial-and-error affair, and in a game like this I think that&#039;s part of the fun.&lt;/p&gt;
