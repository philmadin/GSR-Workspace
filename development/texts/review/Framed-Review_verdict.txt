&lt;i&gt;Framed &lt;/i&gt;has to be one of the best experiences I&#039;ve had on a mobile device to date. To have top-notch graphics and sound design backed up with incredibly clever puzzles and elegant gameplay, developer Loveshack have created something truly special. It is short at just over one hour to finish, and it certainly isn&#039;t cheap ($5.99 AUD on the app store), but I cannot recommend it enough. &lt;i&gt;Framed 2&lt;/i&gt; has just been released too, so if you need me, you know where to find me *puts on fedora*.&amp;nbsp;
