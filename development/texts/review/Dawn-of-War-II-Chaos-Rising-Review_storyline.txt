The planet Aurelia, a world lost to the warp for a thousand years, has returned along with Eliphas, a champion of Chaos and long time nemesis of the Blood Ravens. Lead by&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color=&quot;#222222&quot; face=&quot;sans-serif&quot;&gt;Araghast the Pillager, the Black Legion has vowed to resurrect&amp;nbsp;an ancient demon and lay waste to the Blood Ravens and their sector.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#222222&quot; face=&quot;sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#222222&quot; face=&quot;sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#222222&quot; face=&quot;sans-serif&quot;&gt;Chaos Rising&#039;s campaign shares many similarities with that of Dawn of War II. Once again you command a small number of squads, each lead by a hero unit. But there are some small changes that bring a new level of depth and purpose to gameplay.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#222222&quot; face=&quot;sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#222222&quot; face=&quot;sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#222222&quot; face=&quot;sans-serif&quot;&gt;First and foremost is a corruption, a system that allows your troops to slowly fall to Chaos. Heroes become corrupted through equipping heretical war gear or undertaking certain tasks in missions. Different levels of corruptions will have different effects. Some characters will talk to themselves, others will refuse to deploy and, when the time is right, someone will betray you. It&#039;s a constant balance between maintaining strength and limiting your corruption and it&#039;s pretty great.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
