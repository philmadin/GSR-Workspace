<br>The visuals of <i>The Final Station</i>, are my biggest complaint. While it mostly features some very good pixel art which, despite my pixel art fatigue, was nice to look at it also has backgrounds and larger foreground elements that are noticeably less pixelated. This creates some jarring moments where I walked through an area that was entirely different to the rest of the world. While a small complaint it is worth noting a it tends to break apart the immersion and atmosphere of the game. <br>
