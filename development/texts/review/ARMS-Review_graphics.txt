The visuals for &lt;i&gt;ARMS&lt;/i&gt; are typically Nintendo; super colourful, bouncy and silky smooth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Running at 60 fps (30 fps with multiple players), &lt;i&gt;ARMS&lt;/i&gt; feels great to play, and the clean artistic style makes the gameplay easy on the eye. After all, this is a game about reading your opponent, so the expressive visual cues need to be clear and concise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I absolutely adore the character and world design, as it&#039;s clear that a lot of thought was put into them. Fighters are basically brands unto themselves, with adoring fans that follow them in each fight (they humorously wear their merchandise, like a pro-westing show). As a result, each one is clearly identifiable and unique, with nice personalities and background stories (hence my desire for a campiagn mode!)&lt;br&gt;
