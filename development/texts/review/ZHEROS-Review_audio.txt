&lt;i&gt;ZHEROS&lt;/i&gt;&#039; soundtrack fits the sci-fi setting of the game,part techno part dubstep. It gives off the galactic adventuring feel that the game was going for.The only downside with the soundtrack that I found was that all of the songs sound the same and after the second stage I found it annoying. For me it took away from my overall experience of the game.&lt;br&gt;
