If you&#039;ve ever dreamt of what you would do if you were stranded in space with limited resources while the whole universe is trying to kill you, Hellion is for you. Yes, it&#039;s rough around the edges and far from complete, but new features and bug fixes are applied almost every week.&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The developers are actively listening to feedback, and are well on their way to creating an incredibly immersive and scarily realistic space survival simulator. If you don&#039;t want to deal with game breaking bugs and limited content that&#039;s completely fine too - just do yourself a favour and keep up to date on its progress. Hellion is definitely one to watch.&lt;/p&gt;
