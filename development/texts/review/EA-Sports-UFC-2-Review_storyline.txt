One of the greatest weaknesses of <i>UFC 1</i> was its lack of substantial single player content. This has been rectified with a more detailed career mode that allows players to take a created fighter through a hall of fame worthy career across several weight classes. <i>UFC 2</i> also brings the exciting addition of being able to create your own female fighters, a first for the series.<p>There is also a new mode called UFC Ultimate Team, where players create a deck of cards using five fighters and then enter online or offline competitions against other players. Players earn coins and XP which can subsequently be used to upgrade their fighters abilities.</p>
