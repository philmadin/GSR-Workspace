Instead of ripping old soundbites from previous titles, a great deal of your adventure will have fresh sound. From music to a hollow moaning, itâ€™s all identifiable and feels fresh. The music is both excellent and familiar. Some boss themes are recycled from previous games in the series, though reworked enough to fit a new character. Given the context of these fights in particular, it is understandable, but still raises an eyebrow as to why.
