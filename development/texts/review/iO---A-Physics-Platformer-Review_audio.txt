The music in &lt;i&gt;iO&lt;/i&gt; is nothing outstanding. The ambient music plays in the background as you progress through the levels, giving the game a relaxing aura.&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It helps you to keep calm, especially when you&#039;re on a difficult puzzle. Although, especially if you&#039;re playing on mobile, you&#039;re not losing much if you turn off the sound altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
