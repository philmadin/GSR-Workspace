This is the strongest selection of vanilla maps ever produced in the series.<br><br>These engrossing landscapes also include destructible environments and a comprehensive list of drive-able vehicles such as jeeps, tanks, bombers, horses and even the behemoths themselves. <br><br>If you don't already own the game check out some twitch streamers to see just how incredible this game looks. Truly a standout in a genre typically populated by graphically impressive titles.
