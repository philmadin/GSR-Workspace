For anyone who played these in their original forms and are looking for a new and improved version, you may be disappointed. There just hasnâ€™t been enough time or technological advancement for true improvements to grossly enhance either experience. However, lovers of both games will no doubt be glad they can play them on the newer systems. They are unique and enjoyable experiences that I hope to see many more of in future, just with more polish.
