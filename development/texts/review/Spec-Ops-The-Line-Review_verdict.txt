Is <i>Spec Ops: The Line</i> the greatest military shooter ever made? Quite possibly, it all depends on what youâ€™re looking for. It tells a mature and engaging story the likes of which are usually reserved for Telltale games and forty hour long RPGs. It is fun to play despite the terrible things it will make you feel and tries to elevate the genre to new heights. Does it succeed in this endeavour? <br><br>Yes, yes it does.
