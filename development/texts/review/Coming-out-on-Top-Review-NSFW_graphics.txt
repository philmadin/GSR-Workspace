The entire game uses still framed images, meaning there is no free movement of characters. Backgrounds switch from detailed to bland, but most often simply act as no more than a backdrop would to a stage play.<br />

The big surprise are the much, much more detailed images revealing the sexual nature of some encounters with other men you meet. The images donâ€™t hold back and may catch a few people off guard, that said, they definitely added a unique flavour to the game and will no doubt leave an impression.
