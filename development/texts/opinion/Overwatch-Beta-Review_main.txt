Blizzard's newest game is bursting with quality characters and fastpaced action.<p><br><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none" align="LEFT"><i style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">Overwatch</i> is a multiplayer first person shooter developed by Blizzard Entertainment. The open beta has held nothing back, allowing every aspect to be tested: maps, characters and game modes. It has also shown it will take some skill to master.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none" align="LEFT"><br></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none" align="LEFT">The beauty of this game is the variety of characters available. There are 21 different heroes, each with their own play-style and role. The four roles are: offence, defence, support and tank. Each hero has a skill level, indicating how easy they are to use.Mastering them is the key to winning. Switching characters is encouraged as the opposing team is constantly evolving their strategy based on the objective of the match. Being able to fill multiple roles means that you understand the enemy and can destroy them.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none" align="LEFT"><br></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none" align="LEFT">While playing, I experienced no lag or disconnects which was surprising for a beta. This is promising for a game that relies on quick reflexes and a decent connection. Overwatch may only have three game modes, but, the amount of maps available and their layouts changed the pace of each mode considerably. Hopefully, in the future,more modes will be added to prevent the game from becoming stale. The control scheme is great and can be remapped for every character, an added bonus.  Blizzard also needs to be mindful when balancing characters. They must not rush on player feedback and adjust as they see fit for the game. </p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none" align="LEFT"><br></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none" align="LEFT">The cartoon style graphics are highly polished and have the classic Blizzard game charm. It would be great if this game had a simple story mode. The cast of characters and their back stories have so much potential, that it hurts to not have it included in game. They have chosen to focus on the multiplayer experience and their choice to not include a story mode is understandable. Instead it can be later marketed through comics and other merchandise. All the characters are all likeable and it makes it tricky to pick a favourite. There are also plenty of collectibles to help customise them like costumes, final poses and voice lines.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none" align="LEFT"><br></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none" align="LEFT">Blizzard has managed to create a game that is filled with a cast of unique characters backed up with well rounded gameplay. For an online shooter, it is fairly balanced with advantages and counters for each character. Blizzard has another potential winner on their hands and needs to make sure they listen to the community, otherwise only the dedicated few will support it.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none" align="LEFT"><br></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none" align="LEFT">*Tested on PlayStation 4<br></p></p>
