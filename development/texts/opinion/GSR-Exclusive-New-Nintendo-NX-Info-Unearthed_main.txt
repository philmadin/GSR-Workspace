Over the last few weeks, the internet has been ablaze with supposed 'leaked' images of the controller of Nintendo's mysterious next-gen console, the NX.Showing a football-shaped joypad with its real-estate taken up by a bright screen and two simple thumbsticks, many opinions were howled – both good and bad – before the person behind the picks held up his hand and admitted his fakery.<p><br></p><p>Nevertheless, rumours are still rife regarding the true nature of the machine. Many signs have pointed toward a possible home console and handheld hybrid, with power equating to that of the PS4 and Xbox One.Well, today, GSR is proud to lift the lid on this enigmatic device – with verified sources revealing just what Nintendo has planned for the future of video gaming!&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>First, the codename 'NX' was changed quite a while ago within the Kyoto-based firm. Realising that the 'Wii' brand is no longer a viable option, there was a unanimous decision by management to go with a different theme. However, Nintendo does not want to abandon the 'Mii' concept – especially considering the importance of the Miitomo app.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Since the word 'Mii' has always been closely tied with 'Wii' in order to make contextual sense, a compromise was made, with the NX name being a combination of something new, as well as evoking the 'social integrity' of Miitomo and Miiverse.Ladies and gentlemen, Nintendo's new console is now called the Nintendo Miidia Portal!The Miidia Portal is basically the new home for everything Nintendo and Nintendo-related. A digital-only device, the console is basically the company's answer to accusations that it hasn't embraced the online world as much as gamers wished.&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">According to our insider source (that cannot be named, due to strict NDA), one if Miidia's designers was quoted as saying [our] consumers have voiced concerns that Nintendo's products have not embraced the advantages of the internet as much as possible. Very often, our biggest detractors have accused [us] of being too stuck in the past; particularly our Western audiences. That our dedication (some would say obsession) to making software that are fully-featured packages at launch has become somewhat 'out of style' (laughs).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Truthfully, such a way of making videogames is no longer cost effective in this current climate. We need to learn to take cues from other companies, and release games as 'free-to-start' or 'base' models at release, and then fully complete the experience at a later date. Some developers have taken issue with this seeming abandonment of 'quality game making' – but it is clear that the people have spoken.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">&nbsp;Games like Destiny and Street Fighter V are what the modern audience wants.As such, the Miidia Portal is described as being '100% symbiotic' with the internet, and that consumers who wish to enjoy Nintendo's future games without being reliant on the web will be “unfortunately left behind.”Microsoft's original plans for the Xbox One were cited as a main influence on the Miidia Portal's direction, with  a constant online connection required in order to “fully take advantage” of the future potential of gaming.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">The 'evergreen' aspect of Nintendo's games (where they continue to sell well years after their original release) have also been taken into account. Taking a cue from Western 'AAA' studios like EA and Ubisoft (who have “shown us how things are supposed to be done”, according to a senior executive), games will be released initially in 'first stages', with patches and updates (at extra cost) being released later. “Some will call these pieces of software 'unfinished,” laughs the same executive “but we prefer to label them as 'free first tastes'.”As aforementioned, emphasis will be placed on social media. The&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Miidia Portal will take pictures of players at random intervals, and will interrupt gaming sessions every 30 minutes in order to ask if you want to post an update for your Miiverse followers.A lot of people took issue with the Kinect spying on them. Yet, they are more than happy to post photos of themselves and reveal their location on Facebook on a constant basis. This made us go 'huh?” (laughs). So, we decided to do the audience a favour, and simply do it all for them. Also, we are also giving them the option for games to complete themselves, if they are too busy taking selfies. At extra cost, of course.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">The Nintendo Miidia Portal will truly be Nintendo's first foray into a realm where they will finally be 'hip' and accepted into a market that only plays 'real' and 'hardcore' games like Minecraft, Call of Duty, and mobile.“If there's one thing Nintendo has learnt over the last 126 years,” our exec added as a final thought, “is that currently popular fads will last forever, and that quick money is more important than maintaining a reputation for quality.”Taking cues from Apple, the Nintendo Miidia Portal will retail for US $799 – and will be updated every year.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">&nbsp;APRIL FOOLS!
