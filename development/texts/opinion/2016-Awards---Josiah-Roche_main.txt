What an exciting year 2016 has been - with the release of many jaw-breaking titles that fans had been waiting for; it’s hard to imagine what will surprise us in 2017.<br><br><b>Biggest Surprise</b><br><br>Destiny. Although it wasn’t released this year, it’s definitely managed to keep up with the latest titles. To be fair, Destiny was once at a standstill between success and failure after producing some lackluster expansions. <br><br>Needless to say, Activision and Bungie have once again impressed me after exploring their latest expansion Rise of Iron.  <br><br><b>Biggest Disappointment </b><br><br>No Man’s Sky had some brilliant marketing campaigns...yet I haven’t had a title provoke me to throw the f*@king thing at a wall before; not since the release of The Elder Scrolls Online anyway.<br><br>For a game that was so highly anticipated, featuring “5 billion years of gameplay”, I thought they’d have more creativity up their sleeves. Not only was the AAA venture a waste of money, but it felt like playing an open sandbox game in Alpha mode – with no interactive building features, no in-depth missions and worst of all, no purpose.<br><br><br><b>Most Anticipated for 2017</b><br><br>Fortnite and State of Decay 2. Fortnite looks incredible! Aside from the cartoonish graphics, the game appears to be a post-apocalyptic survival-builder which allows players to work together to build bases before zombie/monster invasions in the night. <br><br>State of Decay 2 is more of a realistic version of the latter, but is more so comparative to The Walking Dead series, IMO.<br><br><b>Game of the Year (2016)</b><br><br>Regretfully, I haven’t had time to play some of the latest titles that released this year (Battlefield 1, Titanfall 2, Mafia 3, Doom, Ark Survival etc). Though I will judge this based on gameplay experience. From the extremely anticipated trailers to the final delivery, Tom Clancy’s The Division stood out to me the most. The gameplay and addictive loot structure is incredibly appealing. The gameplay dynamics and tricky strategic boss fights were some of the hardest I’ve faced in any game prior. However, the game was less enticing to play after reaching max gear  score level.
