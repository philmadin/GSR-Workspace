Time Commando is an action-adventure computer and video game initially developed by Adeline Software and put out by a handful of various publishers, including Electronic Arts in Europe, Activision in America (US & Brazil), and Virgin Interactive (Playstation port) and Acclaim Entertainment (Sega Saturn port) in Japan. Time Commando also saw a re-released for modern computer systems by GOG.com in early 2012. The popularity of this classic gem is very obvious.<br />

The background of the game world's story initially starts in the year 2020. The military, with the help of a private corporation, has created a super-computer capable of simulating any form of combat from any point in history. A programmer from a rival corporation infects the system with a virus that creates a time-distortion vortex, which threatens to expand across the world and swallow it.<br />
<br />
The game revolves around Stanley Opar, a S.A.V.E. (Special Action for Virus Elimination) operative at the center who enters the vortex to try and stop the virus. Throughout the game, he moves and fights through different periods of time in history, utilising weaponry and equipment exclusive to those times to defend himself on his journey. Throughout the entirety of his battle against the computer virus, he goes through the Prehistoric, Roman Empire, Feudal Japan, Medieval, Conquistador, Wild West, Modern Wars, Future, and finally... The Virus World.<br />
