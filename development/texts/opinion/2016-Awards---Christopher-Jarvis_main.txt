<b>Biggest Surprise</b><br><br>I was a huge fan of the original <i>Watch Dogs</i>, with its innovative gameplay and immersive environment. But it had a lot of flaws that are difficult to look past, so while I expected its sequel to improve upon the formula, I certainly didn't predict that <i><a href="http://gamesharkreviews.com/review.php?t=Watch_Dogs_2_Review&amp;g=Watch_Dogs_2">Watch Dogs 2</a></i> would be one of the best games I've played this year. Between the fantastic RC gameplay and the amount of pure fun San Francisco is, I could not pull myself away from what may just be my new favourite open world game.<br><br><b>Biggest Disappointment</b><br><br>By this stage, I'm sure most readers have heard about how disappointing <i><a href="http://gamesharkreviews.com/review.php?t=No_Man%27s_Sky_Review&amp;g=No_Man%27s_Sky">No Man's Sky</a></i> was, and you may have heard about how the Foundation update promisingly makes the game more interesting. But when it was released, there was no base-building, no creative mode, and nothing to do but be disappointed by everything in the game. Whether it was because of Sean Murray's lies, or whether it was my own fault for getting excited about a game that was never meant to be much more than an exploration game, <i>No Man's Sky</i> is unsurpassed as my disappointment of the year.<br><br><b>Most Anticipated for 2017</b><br><br>In 2005, the game <i>Ultimate Spider-Man</i> was released to excellent reviews. And while I spent far too many hours swinging around in the <i>Spider-Man 3</i> movie tie-in, no Spider-game since has been as much fun as <i>Ultimate</i>. So when I heard that Insomniac, the extremely capable team behind <a href="http://gamesharkreviews.com/review.php?t=Ratchet_%26_Clank%3A_Review_&amp;g=Ratchet_%26_Clank"><i>Ratchet &amp; Clank</i></a> and <i>Sunset Overdrive</i>, would be taking on the webhead, 'excited' doesn't even begin to cover how I felt. Here's hoping <a href="https://gamesharkreviews.com/news.php?t=E3_2016:_Spider-Man"><i>Spider-Man PS4</i></a> is as good as it already looks!<br><br><b>Game Of The Year (2016)</b><br><br>Have you been paying attention? I'm the reviewer behind many of the glowing <i>Hitman</i> reviews on GSR, so it should come as no surprise that this year's <a href="http://gamesharkreviews.com/search.php?q=Hitman"><i>Hitman</i></a> is my Game of the Year. Episode after episode, IO-Interactive continued to impress, entertain, and ensure that I was getting my money's worth all the way through to the present day. Every aspect - storyline, graphics, audio, world, and gameplay - has been refined to such a high degree and I have nothing but praise for this year's legendary entry in the Hitman franchise.
