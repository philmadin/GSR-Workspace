<p>If you're like me and you like some good ol' fashioned fragging while travelling abroad, China is a place where you could struggle. A lot. In order to understand how things work today, we need to look at what's happened in the past, and how the heavy censorship and regulation has created one of the most unique markets existing today.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Gamers in China started out like many kids my age did, in arcades. During the 1980s and 90s, we popped our coins into machines that gave us a couple of minutes fun at a time. PCs and consoles existed but were out of reach unless you had well-to-do parents or friends that did. Even if you owned a PC, the chances of it being powerful enough to run games were very unlikely. The Chinese market also had little to no regulation - piracy was rife, and created an expectation of games/content being incredibly cheap.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>As g<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">aming became more accessible and prevalent, the government feared that gaming devices and 3D worlds produced by them were having a negative impact on the physical and mental development of children. They drew other links too that gaming threatened state security and disturbed social order. With such pressure on Chinese children to perform well in the rigid school system, gaming became a form of teenage rebellion. There are stories of kids sneaking out of school to play games, and others resorting to crime to pay for more game time. It wasn't uncommon for parents to send their 'wayward, digitally obsessed' teens to treatment camps for months at a time.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Fast forward to 2000 and the Ministry of Culture decided to address this by placing an outright ban on foreign consoles. PC gaming was strangely exempt from this and boomed in spite of the expensive cost of hardware, through the rise of internet and gaming cafes. In 2011, PC gaming in China was worth over $6 billion. Consoles and games were still available through the gray market, but were tainted by language issues, region locking and of course fake knock-offs. The console ban was eventually lifted in 2015, however, the trend had been set - PC gaming was the go-to for many gamers.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The final piece to this puzzle is China's infamous censorship laws. Everything from internet access to the content of film, TV, radio and of course games must comply with strict laws and regulations, meaning many AAA games are never released here, and those that do are heavily screened. <i>Battlefield 4</i> never saw the light of day due to 'smearing the image of China and endangering national security', whereas <i>Hearts of Iron</i> was banned due to 'distorting history and damaging China's sovereignty and integrity'. Bones are considered offensive, so games featuring skeletons and skulls have them smeared or replaced altogether. The Chinese also take pride in being descendants of dragons, so any game depicting dragons as evil characters (i.e. most of them), they're gone too. If you want to access banned games or original versions of them, you pirate.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Stay tuned for <a href="http://gamesharkreviews.com/opinion.php?t=GETSTATUS%3A_Gaming_in_China_pt.2">part 2</a> where we bring all this together, painting the gaming landscape that exists today.</p>
