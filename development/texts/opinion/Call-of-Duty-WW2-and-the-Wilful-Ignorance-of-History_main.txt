The next <i>Call of Duty</i> will be releasing later this year and, unsurprisingly, it was shown off at E3. Being set in World War 2, there are a few things one would expect to see. Bolt action rifles, prevalent sub-machine guns, flamethrowers, violence and Nazis. And yet, despite the fact that this is a game very much grounded within a period of history that happened not that long ago, Activision made a very strange choice.<p><br></p><p><br></p><p>There are a number of shots in the trailer that display Nazi colours, but one thing is blatantly absent, the Swastika. A symbol with humble origins that, following the events some 70 years past, became an international symbol of evil is replaced by the less "offensive", and less recognisable Iron Cross.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Be this something more akin to <i><u>Wolfenstein</u></i>, an obviously fictional story wherein the Nazis took victory and changed the course of history. The difference here is that <i>Wolfenstein</i> didn't happen; it's a what-if scenario, a piece of worked from the mind of an individual. This is to say, it isn't a historical event. World War 2 on the other hand, did happen. Millions died as the world burned for six years, and here is Activision willfully censoring it.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><i>CoDWW2</i> is far from a pleasant game. The trailer shows off missing limbs, split skulls, the burning corpses of what were once living people. But to show a symbol? Too far. It isn't the first time this has happened, in fact in Germany, it's always been this way. But it is the first time it has happened in a major title on an international scale and that's unacceptable.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Since E3, PC Gamer spoke with Michael Condrey of Sledgehammer Games, the team behind <i>CoD WW2</i>, and asked about the presence, or lack thereof, of the Swastika. He said, and I quote, "We want the community to play <span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);undefined">together</span>. We want to be respectful of local customs and laws around the world. And frankly, the Swastika is a dark symbol with a lot of emotion behind it we don't feel matches our multiplayer experience." Does this mean the Swastika will be present in single player? Who knows, but if this sentiment is actually true and not the usual corporate trash, then it probably won't be, and that isn't acceptable.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>In an earlier interview, also with PC Gamer, Condrey stated that they wanted to tell an "...impactful narrative and story, largely to ensure this type of conflict doesn't happen again." Claims have been thrown around that Sledgehammer spent years trying to ensure "historical accuracy" and yet, here were, covering up history. So much for being accurate.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>No one is under the illusion that the Nazis are the good guys in <i>Call of Duty</i>. They never have been and it's incredibly unlikely that they ever will be. But the point stands, if you want to make a game about history, embrace it, don't cut out the bits that might offend a select few individuals and act like they never happened. They did happen, the Swastika is a very real symbol, more iconic than anything in any video game, and to censor it, to hide it away, is an offense to those who fought to bring it down.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>The views of the author are not necessarily those of GSR</b><br></p><p></p>
