The latest attempt in the long history of taking video games to the big screen is <i>Assassin's Creed</i>. And, like most of what came before, it's not great. While it's far from the worst film in the genre, that honour falls to any one of Uwe Boll's movies, but it's far from what it could be.<br><br><p><i>Assassin's Creed</i> falls prey to the problem with almost all video game movies, it tries to cram everything from the game series into a flick that's less than two hours long. <i>Warcraft </i>earlier last year suffered from the same issues, though to a lesser extent. Everyone who's played the game knows that the interesting parts don't occur in the present day, yet the film seems to think that's what everyone wants to see. Roughly three quarters of the movie is spent within the Apple/castle-styled interior of the utterly dull Abstergo facility. The real kicker is that the 20 minutes spent in the past is really good, like, some of the nicest action and visuals of the year.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Other than <i>Assassin's Creed</i>, last year we got <i>Warcraft</i>, <i>Angry Birds</i>, <i>Ratchet and Clank</i> and <i>Dead Rising</i>. Compared to the last five years in which we got two <i>Resident Evil</i>s, <i>Silent Hill</i>, <i>Need for Speed </i>and another <i>Hitman</i> movie. It's quite clear that video game movies are coming out more than ever. But will they ever stand tall amongst today's comic book movies or action films?</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Even the cinematic titan that is Marvel Films took some years to really get somewhere. After a number of downright terrible films such as <i>Daredevil</i>, <i>Hulk </i>and the original <i>Captain America</i>, we now see modern classics like <i>Iron Man</i>, <i>The Winter Soldier</i> and <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i>. And yet, since the 1993 release of <i>Super Mario Bros</i>, we've seen video game movies ranging from the utterly terrible <i>House of the Dead</i> to the entertaining but still not great <i>Tomb Raider</i> films. And it's not like these films are lacking in star power either. Angelina Jolie, Bob Hoskins, Christopher Lambert, Dwayne Johnson, Jason Statham, Sean Bean, Jean Claude Van Damme, Michael Fassbender, Jeremy Irons, Paul Giamatti, John Goodman and Sylvester Stallone have all featured in these movies. But here we are, on the eve of somewhere between 30 to 50 films planned to be released over the next few years including <i>Asteroids </i>and <i>Rampage</i>.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Maybe, just maybe, one of these movies will realise that trying to cram anywhere between five and 20+ hours of content into a two hour film, and relying on the selling power of names alone isn't the way to go. Not to bash <i>Assassin's Creed </i>any more, but a film set solely in the past without mention of the animus or Abstergo, and one in which a guy with a cool hood and a hidden knife tries to stop a maniacal order from conquering the world is what people want to see, not Michael Fassbender pretending to run up walls that exist within his mind or fighting hallucinations. <br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>There's plenty of content to choose from and there's more than a few interesting and varied worlds in which to set a film and maybe, with a little thought and understanding, we'll get a good video game movie one day.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>This article is the opinion of the author, and does not reflect the thoughts of GSR.</b><br></p>
