With the recent introduction of new taunts, skins and weapons, anger has been stirred in the COD community. Has the series lost its way when only certain items can be obtained by luck or with money?<br />

<h3>Pay To Win</h3>The latest patch for Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 has divided the community as the new weapons are not available to all. They can only be found on the Black Market and are purchased with COD Points or Cryptokeys. The latter way is slower and earned by time spent playing the game. While the Black Market is random, the purchasing of COD Points allows for more chances of receiving a rare item. This allows a lucky few to have an advantage over the community who are unable to obtain the weapons any other way. Advantages, even small ones, should not be locked behind a random paywall.<br />

<h3>Cosmetics Only</h3>In a game that is primarily focused on gun battles, everyone should be on a level playing field. By having it based on luck, it takes the prestige out of earning the weapons and mastering them. The Black Market should be limited to skins for both heroes and weapons as it does not directly affect the gameplay. It cheapens the experience as you may never get the weapon regardless of the amount of time or money invested.<br />

<h3>Form of Gambling</h3>The Black Market can be seen as a form of gambling. There are three chances with each attempt. Like any good slot machine, it will pay well once in a blue moon, to keep the player hooked; most times it hands out junk. A person can easily spend $200 and receive nothing in return. This can quickly escalate, as an addiction takes hold and the person pours more money in, hoping for something rare. It's a shady tactic to earn money off people with bad habits. Furthermore, it's exactly what the community is vexing about, to prevent it from becoming a normal procedure for companies to include IAPs. <br />

<h3>How Should It Work?</h3>There are many approaches Treyarch can take when implementing new items into the game without chance becoming a factor. They can be tied to level, challenges or a certain amount of Cryptokeys to unlock them. If money is an issue, then it can be included via DLC, season pass or a set price from the PSN store. The control should always be with the player. Dividing the community in such a controversial way, may have negative repercussions in the future. While it is a person's choice on how they spend their income, encouraging micro-transactions in this form will only encourage companies on finding new ways to pay for content that should be available with the game.
