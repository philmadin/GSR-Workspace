Star Wars Battlefront. A title that embodies what video games are capable of within the Star Wars universe. The very name itself brings back fond memories of playing split screen with my younger siblings having an incredibly enjoyable time. Star Wars: Battlefront I and II both had their fair share of issues but they both also exhibited some of the most sublime Star Wars gaming moments of all time. Something that has still not been achieved over a decade later.<br />
<br />
Star Wars Battlefront is easily one of the most controversial releases of 2015 and for good reason. When rebooting such a widely beloved franchise there comes a certain level of expectation that fans place upon the license. In this case all the initial signs were great. Multiplayer maestros DICE were taking the helm and the official teaser trailer was met with overwhelming positivity. There was a huge buzz all around.<br />
<br />
I remember when that teaser came out I was overcome with excitement. I had friends that were non-gamers (damn casuals) that were excited when they heard. This was the game that Star Wars fans have been waiting a long time for and one we could all band together to enjoy. In the end, the majority of us were disappointed. <br />
<br />
Just to be clear Battlefront is not some hulking monstrosity that defiles the brands name. In many ways it is a really well done homage to the original trilogy. The visuals are among some of the best I’ve seen in a game this year and the soundbites are completely on point. Blaster sounds, explosions, that John Williams theme. It’s all as authentic as it gets but at the same time it is lacking so much (View the GSR review to see what’s missing). <br />
<br />
It’s impossible to deny the parallels to the prequel trilogy. The hype was there, the fans were eager and the potential was limitless. After all, it had been ten long years since this series had been visited and it has aged exceptionally well. Yet despite having a blueprint to work from, despite having talented developers, despite being Star Wars; this game has garnered publicity for all the wrong reasons. <br />
<br />
Rather than being the next logical step in the series, it is in many ways a step backward. There are no space battles. There are no prequel units. There are very limited heroes and planets available. What makes matters worse is that there are already four confirmed expansions to the main game. Not map packs but expansions. This game feels like it has been stripped to its core and then delivered to the public.<br />
<br />
Is this because of Electronic Arts DLC interests? Was this purposely done to squeeze every possible dollar out of the fans? It sure looks that way. Which is beyond disappointing. The Force Awakens release coinciding with Battlefronts is no accident. TFA will play an enormous part in generating the largest Star Wars player-base in a very long time and those same deprived Star Wars gamers are exactly who EA is targeting. <br />
<br />
Regardless of the hordes of critics, the game itself is fun as hell and is about as close to reliving the events of the films as we’ve ever seen. But it is missing what those original films were absolutely loaded with - Heart. This doesn’t seem like fan service. Though, It doesn’t need to be this way.<br />
<br />
This can be rectified. This can be fixed. The dark side of paying more for less content doesn’t have to be the path that EA goes down. The damage control will need to be swift and this may cause a hit to the profit margin but if they want this to be a sincere reboot then it is necessary. Firstly, halve the season pass price. It is ridiculous and a complete rip-off ($75?!). Secondly, release several free map packs. The battle of Jakku was a good start and it needs to be the first in a snowball effect. Thirdly, create a space battle mode. Not fighter squadron, not more fighters in the current modes. A space battle mode. This is called Star Wars. Star Wars has battles in space. How was this not included?<br />
<br />
Battlefront cannot afford to segregate its players any more with future expansions. There simply won’t be enough people to populate the new modes and maps (Some modes even now are struggling).  In order for its survival Battlefront needs substantial free DLC to keep players around and to regain credibility. <br />
<br />
It can be argued that Battlefront failed due to its lack of content. It can be argued that it succeeded due to its sales figures. That is all irrelevant. What matters is how this game will be remembered in relation to Star Wars and right now it’s not favourable. The amelioration of Battlefront is still possible but it will need to happen before the fan base moves on. In order for me to remember Battlefront 2015 positively I will need to see some changes. The fans are calling out to you EA, just listen. <br />
