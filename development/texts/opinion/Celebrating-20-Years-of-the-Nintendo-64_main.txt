<p>On this very day 20 years ago, Australia and Europe were finally able to get their hands on the much-hyped Nintendo 64. We had to wait nine long months after it's release in Japan to get that controller into our hands, but what a wait it was.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Nintendo joined the 3D gaming generation that was dominated by Sony's PlayStation and the Sega Saturn. When it was first released, it promoted advanced 3D graphics and a level of immersion we had yet to experience. Running a 64-bit processor at 93.75 Mhz with a whopping 4MB of RAM, it was capable of outputting at a resolution of 320x240; which was later able to be expanded to 640x480 with the Expansion Pak upgrade - Its release was a game changer.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The Nintendo 64 was responsible for introducing us to the analog thumb stick that we know and love today. It also pioneered the way that game design was approached. Super Mario World and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time introduced us to camera controls in a 3D space, and showed us what adventures could be had in an open world.&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Star Fox 64 introduced us to the Rumble Pak, providing us with force-feedback that is now standard in all consoles.</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Goldeneye 007 was pivotal in the development of first person shooters, shifting to objective-based design and multiplayer - while split-screen at the time (how glorious that was) opened the doors for the franchises we know and love today.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">On the topic of split-screen, having the ability to seat four people in front of the same TV playing the same game, together showed us just how social gaming could be. Mario Kart 64, Mario Party, Super Smash Bros, the aforementioned Goldeneye and its sister Perfect Dark, Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey and many more were all responsible for ridiculous hours spent laughing, competing and accusing each other of screen cheating.</span></p><p></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Unfortunately Nintendo's decision to enforce strict policies on third party publishers and to stick with the cartridge format for games meant that in spite of it's explosive release, long-term support was not sustainable. Nintendo only managed to ship 33 million consoles whereas their direct competitor Sony sold nearly 110 million PlayStations.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">In spite of this though, many of us look back on the Nintendo 64 with fondness and is still responsible for some of the most-loved titles ever released. My personal '64 gets pulled out regularly for some solo adventures in Donkey Kong 64 trying to get those last Golden Bananas, or blasting around Koopa Troopa's Beach with mates. I'll certainly be blowing out a cartridge or two for a commemorative play this evening that's for sure.</span></p>
