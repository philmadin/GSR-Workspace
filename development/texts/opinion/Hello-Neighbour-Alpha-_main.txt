<br>Have you ever had a neighbour that made you think 'something just isn't quite right with that guy'? Even if you haven't, that's the basis for <i>Dynamic Pixels</i>&nbsp;offering <i>'Hello, Neighbour!'. </i>I&nbsp;was lucky enough to gain access to the Alpha build of this stealth horror game and it's shaping up to be stand-out.<p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Having moved into the neighbourhood and seeing the moustached <i>Neighbour </i>skulking about near his basement door, you take it upon yourself like home invader would and try to find out what evil lurks within. What separates this from other games of the genre is the A.I that constantly evolves through each play through. Get caught coming through the back door and you can expect it to be boarded up with a bear trap behind it.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>This ramps up the tension within the game ten-fold as it emphasises the need for stealth based game play. Sounds, use of the environment and unpredictability become your friend as your try to throw the neighbour of your tail, distracting him in one area of the house as you find the means to unlock the basement door.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The game is still in an alpha state which means bugs and crashes can occur but for a game early in development it is quite polished. The art style is distinct and cartoon like which is in great contrast to the tension building tone, while the game play is always varied due to the smart A.I. The neighbours friendly character design gives way to terror and tiny shrieks are bound to happen as you run for your life to live another day.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>It will be great to see the game continually evolve and more additions are made through updates leading up a full release next year. If you are interested in the horror genre and like a small challenge, make sure to keep <i>Hello, Neighbour! </i>on your radar and be sure to check back for our full review upon release.</p><p><br></p>
