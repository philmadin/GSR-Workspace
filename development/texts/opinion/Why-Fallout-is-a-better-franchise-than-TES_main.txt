Guns or swords? No seriously, think about it for a second. What is your preferred form of combat in video games? I for one would have to say there is something uniquely satisfying about defeating an enemy through the art of sword play. I mean who doesn’t love wielding an axe in Skyrim or an enchanted mace in Oblivion? <br />
<br />
Now that I’ve said this you probably think I am a huge fan of the Elder Scrolls series - and I do consider it the benchmark RPG created by Bethesda. As much as I appreciate this franchise the answer is actually no. It is not the best RPG created or published by Bethesda. The best (IMO) is Fallout and I’m going to tell you why.<br />
<br />
For the sake of argument I will be comparing the last two Fallout releases (Fallout 3 and New Vegas) with the two most recent single player TES releases (Oblivion and Skyrim, sorry ESO). Fallout 4 will also not be under consideration due to there currently being no recent Elder Scrolls equivalent. I will be comparing these two franchises in the following three areas: combat, story, and player choice. <br />
<br />
COMBAT:<br />
<br />
One of the reasons Fallout has superior combat is without a doubt due to V.A.T.S (Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System). By pausing the real-time combat, Fallout allows players to experience glorious in-game cinematic kills that show up close and personal views of individual bullets landing, grenades exploding etc. This results in extremely gratifying kills that are complimented by slow motion decapitations and dismemberments. It also delivers a real sense of accomplishment when facing off against pivotal or challenging NPCs. <br />
<br />
The V.A.T.S was present in both of the Fallout games while in TES it is more of a hack and slash affair. I noticed in Skyrim that Bethesda attempted to introduce cinematic kills, but more often than not, I saw the same animations much too often and never really felt as satisfied after a fight. Enemies also often fell to the ground in the exact same way after being struck down which felt very rigid as opposed to Fallout. <br />
<br />
STORY:<br />
<br />
This is the single largest mismatch of the two in my opinion. Fallout has a very humanistic approach with overarching themes of rebuilding civilisation coupled with sacrificing for the greater good of humanity. Fallout does a superb job of making the world seem bigger than you individually. It’s frequently enforced that people are struggling to survive and factions are constantly at war. <br />
<br />
The Fallout series allows you to shape the future of humanity with your hands. You are given the power to destroy what’s left of an already devastated world, or try to push on against a universe rife with injustices such as slavery, mutations, and scarcity of food, water and bare necessities. I find this plot far more engaging than both of TES games. Oblivion and Skyrim both share similarities in that the events unfolding are long prophesised end of the world scenarios where a hero must rise up and save the realm. It’s a fantasy go-to. <br />
<br />
PLAYER CHOICE:<br />
<br />
A man chooses. Throughout the countless hours I’ve spent in TES I rarely ever felt emotionally connected to the characters I was questing for. I was told to do this and told to do that without any real option of refusal. The worst that could happen is the dreaded “Failed Quest” text. An example of the lack of player input is the “House of Horrors” quest. This mission forces you to kill a man you just met. Why, why must I kill him? Wait a minute didn’t I spend all of Oblivion fighting these guys, why do I have to obey? If this was Fallout I’d tell that Daedra I’d shove his mace through his face if he got in my way. <br />
<br />
This lack of player choice is mirrored in the games faction system. Whether you’re a Stormcloak or Imperial it does not really matter because there’s no real penalty for picking a side. In New Vegas there was a faction system in place that allowed different groups to have different opinions on you based on your actions. In Elder Scrolls, I could strut on through Solitude donned in full Stormcloak armour and no one would bat an eye. The opposing faction does not recognise you as an enemy even if you’ve slaughtered hundreds of them. This breaks immersion for me.<br />
<br />
In TES you can sit atop an expansive fantasy world with anything and everything you want. In Fallout you scramble to find a place amongst an old world’s ashes. I believe TES has a place in all gamers’ hearts but I don’t think it will ever resonate with me like Fallout does. So from November 10th onwards, you know where to find me.<br />
