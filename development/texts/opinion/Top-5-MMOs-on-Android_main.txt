<p class="MsoNormal">It's hard to imagine a world where smartphones don't exist. I imagine it would be similar to that <i>Futurama</i> episode where Bender abandons society and carves himself out of wood. Except in reality we'd probably all just be out there in the real world doing that uncomfortable thing known as "socialising." Yeah don't worry, I prefer playing video games also. So much so that I compiled a list of the top MMOs that are currently available on android phones. <br></p><p class="MsoNormal"><br><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 28px;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 28px;"><span style="font-size: 28px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">1.</span> </span><span style="font-size: 28px; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size: 28px;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 28px;"><b style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 28px;">2.</b></span> <b style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 28px;">Arcane Legends</b></span><b><o:p></o:p></b></p><p class="MsoNormal">With over 10 million downloads next to its name, <i>Arcane Legends</i> has long been near the top of the mobile MMO landscape. This title brings all the&nbsp;features&nbsp;one would&nbsp;come&nbsp;to expect from a handheld MMO experience. These include, dungeon crawling, looting, boss battles and guild selection. Fans of fantasy adventure will also be pleased to do battle against a who's who list of enemies such as orcs, mages and of course dragons. Some say that the game has fallen on hard times with recent lackluster updates and unfriendly customer service. However, after several years of being regarded as one of the best mobile games available, who's to say that <i>Arcane Legends</i> can't return to its former glory.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sts.al&amp;hl=en">G</a>et your hands on <i>Arcane Legends</i> here!</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 28px; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size: 28px;">3.<span style="font-size: 28px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 28px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 28px;">Clash of Clans&nbsp;</span></b><b style="font-size: 24px; color: rgb(80, 80, 80);"><o:p style="font-size: 24px; color: rgb(80, 80, 80);"></o:p></b></span></p><p class="MsoNormal">Ah yes, <i>Clash of Clans</i>. Through all my darkest moments, alongside all my greatest trials and tribulations there has always been at least one constant to accompany me along the way. That of course is the <i>Clash of Clans</i> advertisement. One of the most memorable mobile marketing campaigns of our time has also remarkably resulted in one of the best mobile MMO experiences. &nbsp;This game lets you create and protect villages, raise hordes and take the fight to other players around the globe. If you have ever been&nbsp;interested&nbsp;in trying out the Android MMO landscape, then this is probably the best place to start.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.supercell.clashofclans&amp;hl=en">A</a>&nbsp;truly classic mobile game</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size: 28px;">4. <span style="font-size: 28px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Mobile Strike</span></b></span></p><p class="MsoNormal">Speaking of big advertising campaigns, it doesn't get much bigger (both physically and financially) than Arnie himself. <i>Mobile Strike</i> is a fast growing MMO that has similarities with <i>Clash of Clans</i>, except instead of building villages you are building full on military bases. Alliances can be forged, arsenals can be built up and as the title suggests, mobile strikes will land with conviction. A fun and addicting game that will make you feel like that '80s action hero you always wanted to be!</p><p class="MsoNormal"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.epicwaronline.ms&amp;hl=en">R</a>ambo your way through military installations here!</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size:28px;color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size: 28px;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 28px;">5.</span> <span style="font-size: 28px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Boom Beach&nbsp;</span></b></p><p class="MsoNormal">Here comes the Boom! It's an odd little game but man is it entertaining. If you haven't noticed yet, there seems to be a definite trend between base building and immense popularity when it comes to android MMO's. That's not a bad thing however, as <i>Boom Beach</i> can stand and trade with the best of the genre. This game is free to play and thankfully is not pay to win like other prominent mobile games are. You know the formula by now, build bases, beat baddies, so on and so forth. What makes this game even more enjoyable is its cooperative play where you take on evil Blackguard Bosses with a friend.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.supercell.boombeach&amp;hl=en">A</a>&nbsp;sunny paradise with chaos and destruction available now!<br></p><p></p>
