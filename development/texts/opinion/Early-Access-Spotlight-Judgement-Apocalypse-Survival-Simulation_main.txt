As a new topic here at GSR, I'll be taking a look at some new and interesting looking titles available for Early Access on Steam. These spotlights will aim to showcase games that try to bring something new to the table and my thoughts/opinions on them after a couple of play sessions. So without further ado let's get right into our first spotlight!<p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Overview</b></p><p><br></p><p><br>Judgement: Apocalypse Survival Simulation is a 2D real time strategy, construction and management game set in a post apocalyptic world. You begin the game with three randomly generated survivors and you must continue their survival by building a base of sorts within a randomly generated area.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>As you build your base and increase your means of production, your "visibility also increases. By visibility I mean that the all seeing demonic eyes will notice your presence and will begin to rain hell down upon you.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Overall, the game works well with regards to the context and general mechanics/game play. The game does however lack a certain number of features that would help make it stand the test of time. It plays similarly to other strategy management titles such as Prison Architect and Rimworld, so if you enjoy those games, Judgement is worth at least checking out.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Gameplay</b></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Judgement plays fairly simply, especially if you have experience with the management simulation genre. The game includes an easy to follow tutorial from the get go, allowing you to set up a functioning base camp quickly.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Once you have your barracks, crafting tables and food production, the game begins to essentially play itself. The AI for the survivors is well set up and easy to understand if you want certain tasks to be more important than others. It is certainly not as deep as I feel it should be however. The system lacks many behavioural aspects for the AI that make each character feel interesting and unique. As such, the characters end up feeling more like mindless drones endlessly performing tasks until told otherwise.Once all of the basics are covered, the tutorial points you in the direction of the world map.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The map shows multiple locations such as shopping malls, schools and other districts. Each of them act as an instanced combat area rewarding successful trip with essential supplies and sometimes other survivors. The quantity and usefulness of the supplies determines how heavily they are guarded. Players are expected to kill every enemy within the area before acquiring the supplies. This can get very tedious however as the combat of Judgement tends to be rather uninteresting to watch and take part in.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>This is due to a lack of both visual flair and any real depth as combat essentially boils down to a series of dice rolls. I would have liked to have seen more variation within the combat Research and development works very similarly in Judgement compared to other management sim games as well. You have multiple trees of research dedicated to farming, weapons and structures. Each tree helps you to become more productive, craft new items and buildings and equip your survivors with better gear. There is one category, however, that stands out from the rest and that is The Occult.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>That's right, your survivors can study the dark arts and wield them for their own gain. This can range from forging items of demonic or holy power, to performing dark rituals and summoning demons to your aid. It's a very fun portion of the game to explore and I'm really looking forward to seeing how they can build upon this interesting aspect of their game.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Graphics, Audio and Performance</b></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Judgement is currently in Early Access so it would be fair to say that some of the assets may change over time during development. As it stands currently the game looks and runs perfectly fine.&nbsp;Judgement has a very gritty aesthetic to the environments and its characters. While this can be seen as fitting with the theme and style, it can get a little drab to look at. Some elements of the game can even get lost at times admist the mixture of brown, green and grey. As for audio, the music for the game works well to set an ambient and sinister tone.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The sound effects work perfectly well, however their repetitiveness will often lead to muting them. The game could use more pitch variation in it's audio so as to try and relieve this issue.ThoughtsAs this current stage, Judgement feels like it could be shipped tomorrow and the game would work perfectly.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Unfortunately it would also not be received as highly as it could be. A mixture of dull combat, repetitive animations and audio, and a lack of interesting behavioural AI and player choice bring down the game as a whole. I'm sure the developers at Suncrash will be continuing to work hard on this game in the future and that these issues will be addressed in time. Until then, I recommend playing a game that can do it better.</p>
