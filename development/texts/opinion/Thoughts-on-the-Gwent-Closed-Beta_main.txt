<br>Gwent began life as a game within a game, a distraction from the world of kings and monsters that was The Witcher 3. For what it was, a surprisingly deep and enjoyable card game, it was pretty fun and quickly became a high point of the game. Seizing the opportunity and travelling where Blizzard's Hearthstone trod, CD Project Red began development of a stand-alone, online Gwent but, unlike the aforementioned Hearthstone, Gwent &nbsp;is developed by a team who have very little experience developing online experiences, at least within the much beloved Witcher series.&nbsp;<p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The online connection is tenuous at best with myself and my opponents experiencing regular dropouts. And, without a connection, you're incredibly limited in what you can do. While there is a single player mode and a campaign in development, you are unable to create decks which is undeniably a major part of gameplay. Add to this a non-existent matchmaking system where I was connected to opponents three times my level, or to those who were less than half. There's a ranking system as well, albeit one that seems angled toward forcing you into accessing the micro transactions to gain more and better cards. You rank up so slowly and the rewards are so minimal that by the time you get around to accessing them you've probably lost your connection.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>While the actual game is fun enough and the cards themselves have very nice artwork and some solid abilities, it often falls apart due to the incredibly over-powered nature of a few of the decks. It's also slow where it should be fast, for instance, in the switching of turns, and too fast when it should slow down, when seeing the abilities of cards played against you.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>I am fully aware that the game isn't finished and that it will, hopefully, change a lot before release. But I can't help feeling that it would have fared far better as a physical game rather than a digital one. Regardless, Gwent&nbsp;is never going to be Hearthstone, not even close, but, if they iron out the issues and polish it up some more, it will, at the very least, be an enjoyable distraction.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>This article is the opinion of the author, and does not reflect the thoughts of GSR.<br></p>
