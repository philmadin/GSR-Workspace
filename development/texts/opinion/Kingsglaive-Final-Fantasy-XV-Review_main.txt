<b>WARNING: THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS</b><br><br>Initially revealed as <i>Final Fantasy Versus XIII</i> in 2006, <i>Final Fantasy XV</i> has had on heck of a tumultuous development cycle.<br><br>Now in its 10th year of gestation, the game will finally see release on November 29th, and with it has arrived a slew of multi-media side content.<br><br>In an effort to create hype for its new universe, Square-Enix has unleashed a wealth of spin-offs that aim to flesh out the world of Eos, including mobile games <a href="http://na.square-enix.com/us/games/justice-monsters-five">Justice Monsters Five</a> and <a href="http://www.finalfantasyxv.com/kingsknight/">King's Knight - Wrath of the Dark Dragon</a>, 2D brawler <a href="http://www.finalfantasyxv.com/en/kingstale">A King's Tale - Final Fantasy XV</a>, and the anime digital series <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbhHt7tfNMCAKp5X5y1UMg6er-xFUyB3J">Brotherhood - Final Fantasy XV</a>. Square-Enix have even seen fit to create a real Audi based on the game's car, and a clothing line based on main character Noctis and his friends' threads!<br><br>Clearly, the studio is expecting big things from their holiday blockbuster, and perhaps the biggest sign of this is <a href="http://www.kingsglaivefinalfantasyxv-movie.com/site/">Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV</a>.<br><br>The third <i>Final Fantasy</i> movie, after <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0173840/">Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within</a> in 2001, and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0385700/">Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children</a> in 2005, <i>Kingsglaive</i> is the latest lavish CGI production that once again puts the RPG series in the silver screen spotlight. Much has been said about this film, with its photo-realistic depiction of its characters, and its world-building set-up that - depending on who you ask - either fails or succeeds.<br><br>You see, there has been great consternation regarding <i>Kingsglaive's</i> quality. Professional critics have given this film a thrashing, citing its nonsensical plot and vapid cast - yet, consumers have been more accommodating of director Takeshi Nozue's work, praising his handling of <i>Final Fantasy XV's</i> bombastic introduction to audiences.<br><br>Honestly, prior to watching it myself, I was more inclined to side with the critics. After all, I found <i>Spirits Within</i> to be serviceable, and <i>Advent Children</i> downright terrible, so I silently attributed the opposition to <i>Kingsglaive's</i> critical drubbing as a simple case of sour grapes from fans. Nowadays, I see cries of incompetence toward film reviewers everywhere I look, as certain works are either seemingly overhyped (<i>Ghostbusters</i>) or unfairly panned (<i>Batman vs. Superman</i>, <i>Suicide Squad</i>), with consumers showing that (to put it simply) reviewers are getting it <i>wrong</i>.<br><br>Of course, such an extreme viewpoint is pretty silly. Reviews are just opinions. Nothing more, nothing less. Even though I thought movies like DC's aforementioned heavy-hitters were actually pretty okay, I still saw glaring flaws within them - and as such, I understood that fact that a relatively low-key videogame movie like <i>Kingsglaive</i> would score a mere <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/kingsglaive_final_fantasy_xv_2016">13% on Rotten Tomatoes</a> and <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/movie/kingsglaive-final-fantasy-xv">35% on Metacritic</a>. It was after all, just a cheesy little Japanese film designed to sell a game... right?<br><br>After watching <i>Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV</i> - there was one thing that entered my head, as I watched the credits roll.<br><br>The movie critics were <i>wrong</i>.<br><br>There is just no other way I can say it. <i>Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV</i> is not only the best film in the trilogy, but it's one of the best videogame-based adaptations I've ever seen.<br><br>That's not to say its <i>perfect</i>. Absolutely not. But so bad that it warrants a <i>13%</i> aggregate? Hop on a Chocobo, and get outta here!<br><br>Either way, let me set it all up for you. Basically, the film serves as an introduction to <i>Final Fantasy XV</i>, as it depicts the invasion of the kingdom of Lucis by the dastardly Niflheim empire. In the world of Eos, sacred crystals gave nations magic power (as is tradition with FF) - however, over time, all but one have been destroyed - and that is the one possessed by Lucis. As such, Niflheim has used its technological superiority to slowly usurp most of the world, with its final target being the city of Insominia - the capital of Lucis, and haven of the crystal.<br><br>The royal family of Lucis can use the power of the crystal to imbue themselves and their citizens with magic power, whilst creating a powerful force-field that covers Insomnia. In its safe bubble, the city has become technologically advanced, whilst the world outside has regressed. However, the wall is now faltering, and Niflheim is relentless in its assault. King Regis (Sean Bean) is weakening rapidly, and begins to contemplate a peace-treaty with his enemies.<br><br>This brings us to the Kingsglaive; an elite paramilitary force that defends Insomnia. The main hero of the film is Nyx Ulric (Aaron Paul), a Kingsglaive who uncovers a dangerous political plot that ends with death and betrayal. He eventually teams with Princess Luna of the Niflheim-occupied realm of Tenebrae (Lena Headey), who is also in Insomnia with her own mission.<br><br>As you can probably tell, the plot to Kingsglaive is pretty complicated - but it's nothing as mind-bending as some have claimed it to be. Sure, there are names to learn and many characters that fill the two-hour running time, but the core plot is actually quite a simple one. Even my non-<i>Final Fantasy</i> playing family member - who came into this story completely blind - could still tell what was happening.<br><br>Of course, there are certain aspects that will simply be alien to those who aren't fans of the series. Creatures like Cerberus, Ultros, Diamond Weapon and Knights of the Round make awesome appearances, with the only true confusion being caused by the latter (the Knights are only briefly referred to as the hidden defense mechanism of Insomnia, but never explains what they actually are).<br><br>Also jarring is the constant reference to Noctis throughout the story. Other than a brief appearance in a wheelchair at the start (which again was unexplained), he is entirely absent from the story. Yes, the smaller details <i>Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV</i> can be tough to understand, but Square-Enix have made it clear that this is meant to be an introduction to the game - which is perhaps its biggest weakness. This is a movie made to sell a game and tell a wider tale, and taken out of that context, one has to wonder if this can even be judged as a singular experience. I mean, you wouldn't review films like <i>The Two Towers</i> or <i>Empire Strikes Back</i> as products that exist in a narrative vacuum, so is it fair to judge this as the same?<br><br>Putting such philosophical quandaries aside, I nevertheless enjoyed <i>Kingsglaive</i> immensely. As an English film, it avoids the bad dubbing of <i>Advent Children</i>, though some of the lines can still be unnatural, probably owing to its Japanese writers. Still, I found the characters to be very well-done, particularly Nyx, Regis and the slimy Niflheim Chancellor Ardyn Izunia (Darin De Paul). The film is well-balanced between amazing action scenes and quiet moments that really do a great job of world-building.<br><br>Visually, it is simply incredible. Though sometimes the mouth movements can be a bit off, the CGI Square-Enix have concocted is nothing short of remarkable. Combine this with the unique world the artists have built, and I simply cannot compliment it enough. If you've played Final Fantasy or any of its other games, then you know that Square-Enix have some of the best designers in the world, and it's blatantly evident here. Insomnia is a mix of medieval European aesthetics and modern tech like cars, TVs ans smartphones. It truly seems like a real, living breathing world, and this extends to the most minute of details like clothing, armour and weapons.<br><br>Overall, I came into <i>Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV </i>is very little expectation, and came out of it extremely impressed. Yes, I am a fan of the series, and that has undoubtedly influenced my opinion; but, this is who <i>Kingsglaive</i> was <i>made</i> for. Fans like me. Or, at least, gamers who want to dive into the upcoming game, and are eager to learn about the world of Eos. Or, just fantasy fans in general! Regardless, I firmly believe that this movie belongs at the top of videogame Hollywood list (or at least, very close). Sure, it has its quirks, but I sincerely think that it doesn't deserve the hate that it has received in some circles. It was <i>fun</i> - and I can't say that's something I experienced with a lot of movies recently. <br><br>I give <i>Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV</i> <b>4 out of 5 stars</b>. You can buy it digitally now, or get the Blu-Ray on October 4!<br><br>
