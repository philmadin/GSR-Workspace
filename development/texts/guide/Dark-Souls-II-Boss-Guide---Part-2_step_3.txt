<h3>Flexile Sentry</h3> This twin torso Boss has a lot of advantages over you and makes use of them. For one, his arena is slowly flooding and as the water gets higher your movement is hampered making dodging harder and less likely to work. 

His attacks vary greatly depending on which torso is fighting you. The first Torso wields two Spiked Clubs and goes for crushing, sweeping attacks whilst the second Torso wields two large Curved Blades that it can slash quickly with surprising range.

Try to fight the Clubbed torso as he leaves greater openings for retaliation. Lightning attacks help as the water in the arena will enhance the effect, so those with a Lightning Spear will have an easier fight. Summoning help is always helpful if you are struggling however make sure to grab Lucatiel of Mirrah or Bradley of the Old Guard once youâ€™ve cleared the way to the boss room as they are susceptible to falling off the map.

In NG+ there will be two agile enemies in addition to the Boss. They will leap in immediately and are very aggressive. However they have low health and once dead the fight is back to normal.
