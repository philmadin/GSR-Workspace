<h3>Darklurker</h3> This is an entirely optional boss that would be classified as one of the most difficult, depending on your method of play.

Darklurkers abilities are many, so lets list them all. He can launch a Soul Spear, Teleport, flies into the air and fires a powerful laser, has a blade of magic that he can swing in repeatedly, summons portals that will either fire three rapid Forbidden Sun fireballs that are very dangerous or sends a sort of Dark Orb through one portal that comes out at another portal and flies towards you for heavy damage, he can detonate a magic explosion and can duplicate.

To combat all of these attacks you should prepare to repel Dark Magic. Nearly his entire moveset is Dark so, if you can raise you Dark Defence high enough the fight can become much safer. His weakness is lightning and fire. Bring some Resins or infuse with spells to cause maximum damage, especially for melee builds who will struggle against such a magical foe. For spell casters, casting Profound Still will help as it mutes all of his magic bar his magic sword. Lightning Spear will demolish him fairly quickly and any Pyromancy that has a blast radius such as Flame Swath will help not only to hit him, but his duplicate simultaneously.

When he begins to create his copy he will curl up into his own wings. He is susceptible to damage here, as is his copy. Since they share the health pool now, hitting both with a Flame Swath or any spell that has a blast effect will do amazing damage so take full advantage of their shared life.

When Darklurker splits into two, do your best to keep both in sight. They don't necessarily wait for each copy to attack. You are able to be attacked with multiple lasers, multitudes of Forbidden Suns and crippling amounts of Magic Blades. How well you manage the fight at the point of his Mitosis will determine how easy victory will come.
