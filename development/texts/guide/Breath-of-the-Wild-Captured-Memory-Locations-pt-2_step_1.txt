<h3>Shelter from the Storm</h3> Is quite close to the Great Plateau, and is found south west of the Dueling Peaks region. Fast travel to the Bosh Kala shrine, cross the Proxim river and then head south. You’ll see the aura just before you get to the border with the next region – look for a tree and some rocks on the cliff side.
