The Eagle Heavy Rifle is a solid all round weapon that, while it doesn't excel in any areas, is perfectly suitable for almost any scenario. While it does have low accuracy, ammo and rate of fire, its damage and stability more than make up for it. Fired in single shot, you can pop heads all day long and so long as you keep an eye on your ammunition, it won't let you down. I run the Long Barrel, Rail Extension and Pro Grip to aid in accuracy as well as The Bigger The Better Suppressor with silencer skills to increase damage and accuracy. Again, I use the Military Laser Module and Solar Sight, though these are just my personal favourites. A suitable alternative would be the AMR-16 though it suffers from many of the same problems, and more.
