<h3>Father and Daughter</h3> Can be found in the grounds of Hyrule Castle, just outside of Princess Zelda’s Study. Consequently, it is THE most dangerous and difficult memory to find, but can be aided by having the Zora Armour to skip combat and speed up the process.
Head to the north east side of the castle and take the waterfalls to the very top (you’ll see a rocky outcrop to the right). Go right around the back of the castle, sprint past the Guardian turret on the wall, and climb onto the outside wall when you come to a sheltered path way. Head up the cliff until you reach the back of the Sanctum area, then head around the castle once again. To the west you’ll find a tall turret standing aside from the main castle, simply glide down to the walkway connecting it to find the memory.
