Finally, we'll talk briefly about unlockables. For better or worse almost everything comes unlocked on the Deluxe edition from the start, but there are still some shinies for us to chase. As previously mentioned, vehicle parts are unlocked by collecting coins. Every 30 coins will net you another part, with this changing to every 50 coins once you've collected 500 total coins, and 100 after 1500. There are 23 karts, 17 bikes, 21 wheels and 14 gliders to be unlocked via this method, requiring 3100 coins to get them all.
