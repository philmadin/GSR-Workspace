<h3>ORBS:</h3> Let’s start off with orbs, since they’re the item with the widest spread in terms of usability. Orbs are predominately used to purchase new characters for you to wield, as well as to upgrade your castle to earn more EXP in battle; fill up your stamina meter and to prevent a game over when your army is overwhelmed. 

You mostly earn your orbs by completing main campaign missions, but unfortunately you are only awarded one regardless of any difficulty. Luckily for us, Nintendo helps us out in the beginning of the game by giving up 20 orbs, plus various app-release events and weekend logins grant us one or two along the way. Also be on the lookout for special maps and monthly quests, which can reward you with a number of orbs as well.
