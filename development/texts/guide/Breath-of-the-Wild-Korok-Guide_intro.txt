The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is the biggest game in the history of the franchise.<br><br>Amidst the countless weapons, shrines and quests - there is one particular collectible that dwarfs them all - the Koroks.<br><br>These pesky forest spirits number 900, and are scattered all over the game world. Finding one of them nets you a Korok Seed, which can be given to a particular character in exchange for extra weapon slots.<br><br>Koroks can be found anywhere and everywhere, yet, there is no in-game guide to finding them. <br><br>However, GSR can help with that! Instead of blithely telling you where they all are (which would ruin the exploration aspect of the game), we have instead endeavoured to make a list of the types of locations where you'll be able to find the pesky critters!<br>
