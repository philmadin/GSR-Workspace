<h3>Black Dragon Kalameet</h3> An optional boss that you first meet on a bridge in the Royal Wood. The second Interaction is a wipeout. Kalameet will fly across the skies and breathe his black fire, destroying everyone who tries to, say, enter his lair. Your third attempt, now that Gough has shot down the dragon for you, is the true fight. 

Kalameet's attacks are like a fusion of Fire and Dark. His physical attacks are normal enough, however should he breath flame at you it will be black and will punch right through your defences, so you’ll just need to get out of range for his fire attacks.

He has one more unique attack. Should he raise up onto his haunches and a shrill ringing be heard, Kalameet is attempting to imbue Calamity on you. Calamity is a status effect the Dragon places upon you if caught in his grip that causes double damage to be taken. Obviously no one wants to be taking double damage against a Dragon so avoid this. The tell is clear but it’s effect range is hard to judge so just don’t hang around if he rises onto his back legs. You’ll know if you have been impacted by Calamity as an Icon will be floating over your head.

Your best bet is to stick quite close to Kalameet and whittle him down with attacks this way, venturing a little further out if you're spell based. Staying too far away will cause swooping attacks that will ignore your shield and fire attacks that are hard to evade. Close up however his attacks are blockable and evadable whilst his fire will have clear tells that should give you time to clear out. Stay away from his front and things will be much safer, relatively. 

Even with the best of plans, Kalameet is a matter of trial and error mixed with some luck. Take your time and do your best to learn from him. His tail can be cut off for the Obsidian Greatsword, however this is hard to do, especially on your own.
