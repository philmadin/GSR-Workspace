<h3>Site 2: Resilience Body #1</h3> Next, travel south-east to the second failed outpost on Eos, Resilience. When approaching from this direction, you're likely to first stumble across the body of Gordanus Trenitus, a Turian who died when Kett attacked the base. (Note: Gordanus' body is currently bugged, and disappears after being scanned.)
