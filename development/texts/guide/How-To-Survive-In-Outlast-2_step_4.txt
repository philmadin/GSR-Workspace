<h3>Camera Battery=Life</h3> Manage your batteries or you will regret it. This game is 75% dark areas and you must resist the urge to have nightvision on all the time. Try to do a quick hit to get a general direction and switch it off again. The same applies to your microphone. This drains it like no tomorrow. Turn up the gamma to full in the options menu to ease the darkness.
