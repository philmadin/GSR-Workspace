<h3>Sinh The Slumbering Dragon</h3> My personal favourite, Sinh is a beautiful, challenging fight that you will encounter immediately after Elana is dead. Don’t worry, there’s a Bonfire in between the fights.

Sinh is the Dragon you’ve seen flying around Shulva causing mischief and lighting fires. He is a full Dragon and acts as such. He will breath fire at you, fly around the arena and try to chomp and stomp you. Not only that but any weapon use to hit him will degrade faster than normal. Bring a spare weapon as back up.

Once Sinh awakens his move set is intimidating and requires good timing to evade. Don’t bother blocking, it isn’t worth it, instead learn to dodge his attacks one by one. His fire attacks are laced with Toxin so when he fires his breath don’t linger as the Toxin hangs in the air for a while afterwards. His physical attacks won’t one shot you but will likely do half damage to your health in one hit so at least you’ll have a chance should you make a mistake.

What you want to do is attack from under his head or on his sides. The former is risky but he leaves himself open here more than you’d think and his sides are harder for him to defend against should you reach them. If he flies up, just wait for him to land again. He will attack from the skies regularly so if he shoots his fireball, just sprint away from it, if he breathes a path of fire towards you roll towards it as the flame will go over the top of you this way. If he breathes whilst on the ground, use the chance to hit him in the neck or closer to his chest. If you are at his sides he may coil his neck backwards in an attempt to sizzle you. It’s hard to see this happening as his body doesn’t reflect his neck movements well.

All his physical attacks need careful timing to dodge. From swan dives to swiping his jaws across at you, all you need is to wait for that perfect moment as he’s about to hit you, then roll the opposite way or out of reach.
