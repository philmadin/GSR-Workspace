<h3>Boop!</h3>Lucio isn't as vulnerable as Mercy. Since he has passive heals, he can focus on the situation around him. He can deal decent damage and you shouldn't be afraid to attack incoming enemies. If they come too close, Sound Wave is a great knock-back that can push people to their deaths. Fun way to get Play of the Game too!
