One of the oldest tricks in the book, hold items behind you instead of in your 'bank'. Shells and bananas are great defensive items that can block shots from other players, or hit someone who's close on your tail. Hold the 'use weapon' button instead of just pressing it and you'll be amazed at how many shots you can stop. If you do find a situation where you want to use that weapon offensively simply release the 'use weapon' button to fire as normal. DO NOT hold the Bob-omb behind you though, if that gets hit it will explode, taking you with it.
