Now for some secondaries. First up, the Spec Ops Sub-machine Gun. It's perfect for spraying large groups of enemies or targeting special units. The most important mods are the Extended Mag and Unfolded Stock. I also run Auto Fire to squeeze that extra damage out, along with a silencer and silencer skills. The CMP and Kross Vertex are both suitable alternatives.
