Start crafting the Rainbow Gelato. As soon as you can, you should craft them in lots of 10. This will give you 16, 632 EXP per lot, which is more experience than you would get by defeating the Ancient Napdragon with the Fanciful Feet and Princely Suit on.

Do not use auto mode. You will only get 60% of the EXP this way and the God Mode ability is faster.
