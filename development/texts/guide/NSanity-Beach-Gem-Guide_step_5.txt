Now this is the tricky part. Come forward until you reach the box with the exclamation mark. Once you have hit it new boxes will appear. I would suggest using the D-pad in this bridge section or being very gentle with the analogue stick. The key is not to panic and not to jump too far forward each time you destroy a box. Just lightly nudge the analogue stick forward each time you land on a box and you will be across in no time.
