Koroks can be found by solving these block puzzles scattered around Hyrule. Using your Magnesis tool, you need to lift a errant cube, and place it in the appropriate gap, so that both structures are identical. Sometimes, the block you need is out of sight or further away (but is still nearby), or the structures themselves are separated by some distance (like the one near Lake Hylia)
