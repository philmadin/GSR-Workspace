When adding ingredients to a dish, keep in mind that the more that you add of something, the more effective it will be - cooking three Apples will give you more health than one Apple will. The same goes for buffs: adding multiple Chillshrooms will make heat resistance last longer. You’ll quite often find yourself trying to balance between the amount of hearts restored and the effectiveness of the buff.
That said, four buff items is more beneficial when cooked into an elixir than it would in a meal. And whatever you do, keep elixir and food ingredients separate. Combining them will result in ‘Dubious Food’ that does nothing except restore a small portion of health.
Recipes are also similar to what you would find in the real world. Fish Pie for example, could be made with a kind of Seafood, Rock Salt, Goat Butter and Tabantha Wheat.
