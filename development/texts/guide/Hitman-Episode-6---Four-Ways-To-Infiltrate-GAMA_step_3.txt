One of the Opportunities requires 47 to dress up as Jason Portman and go to his appointment in the hospital part of GAMA. But the Opportunity doesn't explain how to get Portman alone. The spot pictured isn't necessarily the best spot, considering he eventually goes into a bathroom. But for the impatient, you can knock him out here while he stares out the window and then get dressed when the shocked people run to get help. Just make sure there aren't any security guards within range.
