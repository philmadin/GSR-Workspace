<h3>Mytha, the Baneful Queen</h3> A boss with an important mechanic, like the Lost Sinner, that we need to clear away before we enter. At the second Bonfire after the Covetous Demon there is a windmill turning. Light a torch and walk right up to it from this Bonfire and set it alight. This will remove the poison from both the bosses room and the entire Earthen Peak.

Now that you won’t die from poison we can fight Mytha. A sorcerer and lover of her spear, Mytha attacks both physically and magically. Her head acts as somewhat of a catalyst so, prepare accordingly. Her spear is also very long reaching and can flatten you if she wishes it so try to focus on dodging her attacks as well as blocking.

Her biggest flaw is her head carrying hand as her attacks can only reach so far to that side. Take advantage of that and always attempt to attack her from here. But, beware, as she has plenty of attacks at close range intended to knock back your advances.

Speaking of her head, she will throw it at you or spew magic from it occasionally, especially if you’re at a distance. If she throws it it will detonate in a magic explosion with a large blast radius so back off quickly. It can also cast souls spears at you. The two Soul Spears she casts are a single and a group version. The single being, well, one, and the group being a wide, horizontal spray of about 5 seperate spears. The damage is significant but the danger comes mostly from any follow up attacks she may move into immediately following.

For those having a rough time, Jester Thomas is summonable at the entrance to her corridor. He is a Pyromancer and has some truly chilling power, thus is a great choice to overcome Mytha.
