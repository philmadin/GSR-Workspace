<h3>Watch Your Healer</h3>As mentioned in my previous article, if you know your team has a healer, keep an eye on them please. It might mean the difference between a victory or defeat. Don't rage at them either if you think they are doing a terrible job. This is the reason why there is always a shortage of healers in most online games. It is a normally thankless job and easiest to blame. Pass on the feedback in a polite way or play the role yourself.
