<h3>Seath the Scaleless</h3> The first time we meet Seath he’s perched on his crystal podium, laughing at our futile attempts to fight him, then he kills you.

The second time is down in his Crystal Caves. The cutscene will show a brief shot of a shiny crystal ahead of you before Seath swoops in. This crystal is the source of his immortality. Shattering it with any attack will render him vulnerable to your assault. As soon as Seath enters the room, sprint forward and knock down his crystal. 

With Seath now attackable, go nuts. His attacks are long winded, inaccurate and unless he boxes you into a corner, he’s not a great threat. Keep an eye out for his crystal attacks as they cover the floor whilst building up curse. One in particular will knock you down over and over until it goes away, doing damage simultaneously. This can be seen when Seath curls his head and arms down towards his stomach.

He is blind but that doesn’t seem to be used to any effect as a mechanic. Simply attack his belly when you can and evade his attacks. Should you want the Moonlight Greatsword you’ll have a harder time. His central tail behind him needs to be cut off at the tip to acquire it and his tail attacks are devastating. Summoning a friend will make this easier as you can split his attention.
