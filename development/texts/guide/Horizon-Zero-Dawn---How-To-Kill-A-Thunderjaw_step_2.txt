<h3>In A World Of Pain</h3> Now for the fun part. Pick up the Disc Launcher you removed from the Thunderjaw. You should see a yellow icon floating above it when it is on the ground. It is time for payback. Aim the launcher and lay on the damage. Using both launchers will take it to at least half health if you land most of the shots. This is the easiest approach when fighting your first Thunderjaw.
