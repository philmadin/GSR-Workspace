In <i>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</i>, Mr. Everywhere is a collectible bobblehead that can be broken in order to unlock the achievement <b>Mr. Nowhere</b>, providing rewards for your next playthrough such as walking shoes (which make you sneak faster) and The Essence of Defence (which decreases damage taken while blocking). There are 20 to collect across the game. If you miss any, don't worry as your progress is carried over to all subsequent playthroughs.<br>
