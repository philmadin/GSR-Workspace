Although Mario is available from the start, it's worth noting a few little things about Nintendo's famous mascot. Mario is the certainly the best all rounder and is great for the general playing of the game. With solid speed, jump height and power he's also capable of consuming mushrooms to power up, allowing for a damaging hit without ending your run. Keep in mind however that he's not as quick as Toad, so in Toad Rally you may struggle to keep up and keep those fans on your side.
