Part 1 of this guide showed you the first six locations of the Captured Memories quest given to you by Impa in Kakariko Village. Part 2 will show you how to find the second set of memories as well as the final bonus memory that is only unlocked once you've completed the original quest.<p><br></p><p><br></p><p>It is worth mentioning that there are five story-specific memories that cannot be found: four are found by conquering each of the Divine Beasts, with a final memory unlocked by collecting the Master Sword from the Lost Woods. While these don't add to the captured memories quest, they still provide some back story and help fill in blanks. Keep in mind that chronologically speaking, the Master Sword memory is the last in the set - it is definitely worth saving this until you've collected all of the others.</p>
