<h3>Dancer of the Boreal Valley</h3>

This boss is unique in that upon defeating your third Lord of Cinder you are teleported to the room with the Stain Glass window at the bottom of Lothric. This means you may not have much Estus left on your first attempt. The fight is triggered if you approach the statue behind Emma, the lady formerly sitting on a chair, now collapsed on the ground.

The Dancer fits her name well, engaging you with graceful swishing sword attacks that hit with elemental damage. Her first phase is fairly basic however. Dodge her sword attacks and try to attack when she is finished her combos. Her height means you can hang out between her legs and attack from there as her sword swings are fairly wide reaching.

At about halfway the Dancer will summon a second sword with an Ashen effect. With two swords she will become more aggressive and engage in much longer combos, sometimes spinning around and around like a ballerina to slice you to ribbons. She may even grab you and impale you on her sword so just dodge any attack and you will be fine. Patience is key, don’t get too eager as this is when she’ll make you pay.
