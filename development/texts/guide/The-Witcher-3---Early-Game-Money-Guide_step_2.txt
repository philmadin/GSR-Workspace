<h3>Sell (Mostly) Everything.</h3> You can safely sell the majority of items from the "Other" section in your inventory. Make sure you have read all books, notes and have checked quest items before discarding. Get rid of armour and weapons that aren't an upgrade as well. Crafting items are safe to sell as long as you are willing to buy them later in the game for gear upgrades. 
If you aren't sure, place the item into your stash where it wont take up inventory space.
