<h3>Belfry Gargoyles</h3> These guys live at the top of Belfry Luna, one home of the Bell Keepers Covenant. Remember the Gargoyles in Dark Souls? Well let’s fight six of them shall we?

Walking through the door triggers the first two Gargoyles. One to your immediate left and another just ahead of you. Much like The Four Kings their health pool is shared but each individual Gargoyle has their own health bar above their heads. Once one is killed it won’t come back for this fight. The points at which each new Gargoyle spawn are roughly 90%, 70% and 50% health.

So, head to your left and attack that Gargoyle, focusing on one at a time again makes things a little easier and delays the next Gargoyle as the total health pool isn’t being drained as fast as switching between multiple Gargoyles. Be wary of being boxed in as even one Gargoyle is capable of doing a worrying amount of damage. When a Gargoyle becomes weaker it will resort to its fire attacks but this also leaves it open to attacks of your own.

The Gargoyles are more agile this time as well, playing leap frog over you and shanking you in the back or tackling you from the skies. They may also use a lightning strike where one raises it’s Bident up and fires bolts of electricity out randomly. It isn’t hugely dangerous but with two or more Gargoyles attacking at the same time it’s a big annoyance.

Try to keep moving, watch that stamina bar and be careful when healing as they love to poke you while you’re chugging. Ranged players will find things slightly easier. However Gargoyles that are weak may be blocked by more healthy Gargoyles making your attempts at killing one more complicated. 

This fight is also able to be done at any time so if you aren’t having success, come back later when your power can’t be questioned. You may also like to bring along Masterless Glencour again if you so desire. He is under the stairs as you ascend Belfry Luna.
