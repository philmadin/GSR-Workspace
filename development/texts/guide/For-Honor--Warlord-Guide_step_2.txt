<h3>Defence</h3> Defense is where the Warlord can be scary. He has one of the highest health-pool at his disposal. 
You can enter all guard stance and block all attacks from any direction except unblockables. Use this stance wisely as it drains stamina when used and when it deflects an attack. If the enemy attacks from your right or top, press heavy attack immediately after you block the attack. This will throw a heavy attack for confirmed damage. If they attack from your left, hit light with the same timing for a light stab.
If you manage to parry an attack, press guard break right after the parry to bash the opponent with your shield and stun them. This can be followed by a heavy which always comes from your left or a light stab. If you parried an attack from your left, go for a guard break into a top heavy or a light stab.
Warlord is a harasser and can drag opponents for large distance in any direction after a guard break. Hold the guard break button to push your opponents into environmental hazards. Be a considerable distance from hazards so that you can still use them and not have them used against you.
Patience is key. Wait for the opponent to attack. Try to predict and harass as your offence is limited.
