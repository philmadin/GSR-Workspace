<p><b>The following method is only available if you’ve A) bought the Origin Island DLC and B) reached God Rank in the Cooking life.</b></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><i>Fantasy Life</i> is a cute RPG made by Level-5 that puts you into the land of Reveria. It’s less complicated than other RPGs out there, but as is common in the genre, grinding to the highest level takes a bit of time, no matter what method you try. The method described below is found to be the fastest way to reach the mythical level 200, though even this takes roughly four to six hours.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So chuck on your favourite audio book or podcast and prepare to be sitting in front of your 3DS for a few hours.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>Start crafting the Rainbow Gelato. As soon as you can, you should craft them in lots of 10. This will give you 16, 632 EXP per lot, which is more than you would get by defeating the Ancient Napdragon with the Fanciful Feet and Princely Suit on. Do not use auto mode. You will only get 60% of the EXP this way and the God Mode ability is faster.
