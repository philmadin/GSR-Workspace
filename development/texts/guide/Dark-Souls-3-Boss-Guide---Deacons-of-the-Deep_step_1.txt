<h3>Deacons Of The Deep</h3>

Deacons of the Deep are actually a congregation of about 20+ Deacons. The robed fellows you see just outside the fog gate. Each can cause damage through fireballs, physical attacks and dark magic.

Your job is to attack the glowing Deacon, shown by a sort of red aura around him. Just hack through the trash to get to the glowing Deacon, kill him, then wait for the spirit to move to another Deacon. Repeat until the process stops, which is when one single Arch Deacon arises from in front of the large tomb. This is actually where the fight becomes simpler. Just attack the Arch Deacon until dead and you’re done.

Things to watch out for. Fireballs, stunlocking physical attacks from the Deacons, dark magic that builds when the Arch Deacon appears. This attack is easy to avoid, but getting hit by it can be fatal. You’ll know it is happening when ribbons of dark magic are flying upwards to a single point above the Arch Deacons staff. After a few seconds it will launch, following you slightly. Also, once the Arch Deacon arrives there is a sort of time limit as the Deacons will slowly cause a Curse fog to engulf the room. Kill the boss quickly so not to be cursed.

A few summons are willing to help. Sirris of the Sunless Realms, again only if you have her permission. Anri of Astora and Horace the Hushed are also available. Don’t forget to sit at the Bonfire after to spawn the Arch Deacons set at the oversized tomb.
