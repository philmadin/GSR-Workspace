This particular puzzle has a boulder on top of a tower, which requires you to knock it down and place it on the proper space. I couldn't get a screen cap, but Koroks can also be found as flashing lights zooming along the ground, whilst being accompanied by their trademark jingly noise. Hearing these is a sure sign that one is nearby!
