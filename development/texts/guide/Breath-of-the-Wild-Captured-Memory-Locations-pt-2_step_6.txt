<h3>Despair</h3> Is located between the Lanayru Wetlands and Hyrule Field, south east of Hyrule Castle. If you get yourself to the Wetland Stables, cross the bridge over the water and turn left, following the river. You should find a forest underneath a cliff, and the memory is located in the middle of said forest.
