<h3>Dragonrider</h3> Upon entering heâ€™ll be waiting patiently in front of you. This is a fairly straight forward fight with him swinging his Halberd at you and attempting to block your attacks. He is very susceptible to being circled around so take advantage of his poor movement.

As mentioned for the Pursuer, enemies with armour are very weak to Strike weapons, such as a mace. This is very noticeable with Dragonrider as his health will melt away under the assault of this type of weapon.

The Dragonrider arena has two switches that raise platforms to fight on. They are located outside on the way to the fight. You can choose not to raise them, however he will likely knock you off the ledge with a decent swing.

Keep in mind killing the Dragonrider will cause all Heidi Knights to wake up and begin patrolling. Choose wisely before fighting.

Masterless Glencour is available to be summoned for this fight.
