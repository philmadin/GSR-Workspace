The drift button ('R') can also be used for doing tricks off jumps. Pressing this button just before you launch off the edge of a jump will allow your character to do a trick, netting you a handy speed boost upon landing. It is possible to change the kind of trick by holding a direction on your thumbstick when pressing 'R', but this is just to show off more than anything - the speed boost will be the same.
