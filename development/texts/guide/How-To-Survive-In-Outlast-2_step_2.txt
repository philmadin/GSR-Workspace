<h3>Know When To Hide</h3> Enemies like to search and you have to assess whether or not hiding is more effective than running. Hide if you want to avoid confrontation but remember that they can find you there too. You can use grass, barrels, under beds and in dark areas. Make sure to deadbolt doors if possible as those few extra seconds will allow you to escape or hide.
