Finally, the Baby Deagle. While it's far from being my favourite pistol, when it comes to stealth there is no equal. With the Threaded Barrel, Jungle Ninja Suppressor, Micro  Laser, Spike Kite and a pistol sight, it's the perfect silent killer. With plenty of ammo for any stealth mission, enough damage to end anyone that gets too close, the Baby Deagle is hard to beat. Use the Whitestreak as an alternative; although its concealment nor damage isn't as high,this is not a huge concern
