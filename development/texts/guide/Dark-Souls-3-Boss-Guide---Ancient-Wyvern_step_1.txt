<h3>Ancient Wyvern</h3>

Were you not to read this, you’d most likely kill the Ancient Wyvern without realising. From the bonfire, you run to a stairway with a bell at the summit. Here the Wyvern will land and try to roast you. Ignore it and head upstairs. Keep finding stairs, ladders and more stairs until you reach a point that you can drop down onto a bridge of brick severed in the middle. The Wyverns head is below you. Jump down, do a plunging attack, and the Wyvern will die. It’s just that simple.

Your problems will come from combating your way past the Sickle swiping, Axe smashing, fire throwing hooded creatures that can do frightening amounts of damage. Also beware the Wyvern itself, it may attempt to fly up and burn you from your perch. If you can, use the Wyvern to burn away potential foes.
