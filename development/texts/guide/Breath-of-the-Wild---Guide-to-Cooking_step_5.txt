Occasionally you’ll hear a sound while cooking, indicating a random bonus effect. These will either be an increase in duration or effect, and can be guaranteed if you know how. If you’re cooking during a Blood Moon when the enemies respawn, you will net one of these for each item you create. You can also guarantee them by including star fragments or dragon body parts in your recipes.
