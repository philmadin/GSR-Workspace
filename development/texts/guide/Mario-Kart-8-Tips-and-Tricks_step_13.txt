Mario Kart 8 Deluxe introduces two new aids to help newcomers and veterans alike: auto-accelerate and smart steering. These are accessed by pressing the '+/-' button when selecting your vehicle and can also be accessed by pausing in the middle of a race. Auto-accelerate is self-explanatory, however smart steering is a game changer. It helps newcomers stay on track by braking and turning for them, but can also be used in the stupidly fast 200cc cup where braking is absolutely necessary. The only downside to smart-steer is that the final tier of drifting is locked off. Whether or not this is worth it is completely up to you!
