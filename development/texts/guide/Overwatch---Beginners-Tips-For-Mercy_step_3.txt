<h3>Be Very Aware</h3>Be aware of your surroundings and where enemies are. Mercy's small health-pool means she can be easily killed by most of the cast. She is a high priority target as a healer so by sticking with your team, hopefully they will keep them away. This means using cover when you can, as Mercy's beam range is quite good. You can still be in the fight and avoid damage at the same time.
