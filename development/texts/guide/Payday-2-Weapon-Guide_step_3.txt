When you want to get sneaky, but don't want to fend for yourself with pistols or a bow, turn to the Valkyria. I run with nothing more than the Prototype Barrel and a See More Sight. It's decent enough for escaping Shadow Raid or holding out during a jewellery heist gone wrong, but don't expect it to turn the tide. While there are better stealth primaries, none feature the concealability and flexibility of the Valkyria.
