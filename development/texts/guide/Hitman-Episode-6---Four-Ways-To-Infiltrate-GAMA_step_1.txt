Quite possibly the loudest method listed here: start a fight. If you knock out the security guard who stands outside your room, lots of people will see and start panicking. 

Grab his gun then duck back into your room and prepare for a firefight. It doesn't have to become a fight, though, if you hide around a corner ready to grab an unsuspecting guard.
