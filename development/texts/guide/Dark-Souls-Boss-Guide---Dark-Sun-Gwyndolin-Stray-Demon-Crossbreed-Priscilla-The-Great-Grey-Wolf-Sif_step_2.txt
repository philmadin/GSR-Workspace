Stray Demon

Return to the Undead Asylum and youâ€™ll likely meet the Stray Demon, living under the floor of the main Hall. Identical to the Asylum Demon from the beginning aside from one big change, he has deadly magic blasts. 

Regularly the Stray Demon will smash his large hammer into the ground or through the air causing a catastrophic magic detonation that will cause heavy damage if not defended against. Grab a magic defensive shield and use the same method as previously done on the Asylum Demon, just keep in mind the Magic blasts which are clearly telegraphed and have a large effect radius.
