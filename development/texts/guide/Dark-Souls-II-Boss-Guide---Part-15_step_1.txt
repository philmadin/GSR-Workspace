<h3>Throne Defender & Throne Watcher</h3> These two are real charmers. Throne Defender is a heavily armoured warrior armed with a strong shield and greatsword. His buddy, Throne Watcher, is also armed with a greatsword and shield but is lightly armoured and fast. Their other ability is each has an element that they can use when things start to get dire. Throne Defender will imbue his sword with lightning whilst Watcher will choose Magic. This will significantly increase their damage output.

Remember, pick an enemy and focus on it. Not all that new of a concept but it works. Given the Watchers potential danger and lower health pool, it’s a solid choice to bring him down first. It’s really as simple as dodging/blocking his attacks and attacking when he leaves himself open. It shouldn’t take too long a time but you’ll want to be quick about it as he will try to imbue his sword when his health takes a pummelling.

Assuming you bring down one of the pair, he will crouch down but not die. This is where you’re on a time limit. Should you not bring down the final Throne Boss quick enough, he will revive his compatriot and the fight will continue on with two bosses.

Outside the door, just before you trigger the fight are Benhart of Jugo, Bradley of the Old Guard and Head of Vengarl. They’re here for a reason so don’t be afraid to hire their services. Note that should you be facing Throne Defender and Watcher after having defeated the Giant Lord you will be going straight into the fight with Nashandra and potentially Aldia.
