<h3>Offence</h3> The Warlord doesn't have many mix-up options when it comes to attacking up front. He has two basic mix-ups, both of which revolve around the headsplitter leap. The problem with headsplitter leap is that it's extremely predictable and easily punishable. The Warlord is a harasser and counter-attacker. Wait for you opponent to attack and trade blows because all your heavies have hyper armour and cannot be interrupted. 
You have a superior light ability. Time a light attack the same as you would a parry and you will block the attack and hit with a light attack.
Use your head, quite literally. The headbutt is the best tool at the Warlord's disposal. It can be followed up with a guaranteed light. Use this to open up defensive players or as an opener in general.
Warlord's faints are slow so don't be overly reliant on them. If you see the enemy blocking in any direction but your left, throw out a zone attack. It's fast and has decent damage along with a good range.
