Collect as many coins as you can! This serves 2 purposes: firstly, each coin collected gives your vehicle a bit of a 'tune-up' and increases your maximum speed ever so slightly. You can never hold more than 10 coins at once but any collected after 10 will give a very subtle temporary speed boost and will be added to your tally at the end. Secondly, all coins collected go towards unlocking more parts for you to customise your vehicle with.
