<h3>Toadette</h3> The referee from Toad Rally herself, Toadette, is willing to join your team so long as you're willing to collect 200 of each group of toads from Toad Rally - that's 200 red, yellow, green, blue and purple toads. The reward? Exactly the same play style as Toad, in a different skin. That said I'm sure that's not going to stop the completionist in any of us making sure we get every character on that roster!
