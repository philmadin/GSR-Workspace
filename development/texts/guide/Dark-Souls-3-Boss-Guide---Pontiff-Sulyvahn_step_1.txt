<h3>Pontiff Sulyvahn</h3>

A deadly foe to be sure, Sulyvahn is a graceful, fast, heavy hitting boss not unlike the tall white enemies roaming outside. For those struggling make use of Black Hand Gotthard, Anri of Astora and Londor Pale Shade, their summon signs are just outside the door to the boss. Being able to split the bosses attention is a huge boon.

Sulyvahn’s attacks are very fast and deadly, so try to dodge them instead of block them. His weapons are also enhanced with fire and magic on either sword so resistances are useful. In between his attacks Sulyvahn will take extended breaks (at least compared to most bosses) to recharge for another bout. Try to get some hits in during these moments, but also try to learn his move set and predict when he’ll be whiffing an attack right over you. This is also a chance to hit for some damage.

At roughly halfway, Sulyvahn will take a knee and buff himself, allowing him to summon a phantasmic copy of himself. The copy is weaker health wise especially to magic of any kind, but just as deadly attack wise. Fighting solo, try to kill the copy of the Pontiff as quickly as you can. Pyro’s, Sorcerers and Miracle bearers will need only two or three hits to bring it down. They copy each others movesets when together so when the copy attacks, the second is only a few milliseconds behind. Wait for them both to finish then attack. If the Pontiff and the clone fly into the sky, they are about to slam into you or the ground for heavy damage. Should they come for you, dodge sideways, if they slam into the ground, go backwards as they will cause an explosion.

With a summon, split the pair up. They don't often double team the one person so figure out who’s interested in you and engage them. However should the clone suffer heavy damage, or perform an attack, it may teleport back to the original. No matter their distance apart.
