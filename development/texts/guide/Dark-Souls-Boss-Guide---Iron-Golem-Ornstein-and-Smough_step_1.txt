Iron Golem

Iron Golem is big, powerful, and really stupid. Imagine a movie where a child is trying to escape a very tall person, running between their legs and simply staying out of reach. That’s this fight in a nutshell as blocking won’t help. In fact, spending the fight two handing your weapon will be better as you can increase your damage output.

Staying out of his reach, preferably just behind him is your best bet. Stay there, assault his legs and back off when he attacks. Eventually, if you’ve done enough damage, Iron Golem will begin to wobble in place. This is a chance to not only get some free hits in but also knock him over onto his butt. Once he’s fallen over he’ll stay down for quite a while so do as much damage as you can here.

Your main concern is the arena itself. There isn’t a lot of room and some of the Golem's attacks, should they connect, can cause you to be hurled off the side. Stay near the centre, don’t be in front when he attacks and try to avoid locking on to him.

For those that can’t manage or want to just watch the fight as an observer, before the arena there is a bridge that leads to a second tower. Inside this room is the Summon sign of the immensely powerful Iron Tarkus. This wonderful specimen of power will likely manage to kill the boss on his own, or at least with minimal assistance from you.
