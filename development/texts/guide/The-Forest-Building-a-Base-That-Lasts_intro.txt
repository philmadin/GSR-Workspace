So, you've entered a new and exciting world. It's your first night and you're walking aimlessly, torch out and hacking at trees as you pass by.&nbsp;<p><br></p><p>"Well this is easy", you think to yourself as a couple of minutes pass by uneventfully.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, out of the trees appear ghastly shapes, surrounding you, squealing and calling in delight. You feebly attempt to attack them, but you have nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>This is the fate that awaits you if you don't build a base in <i>The Forest.&nbsp;</i></p>
