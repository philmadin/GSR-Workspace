Princess Peach is certainly one of the slower characters in the game and caters to the more careful player. She is unlocked by beating every level in World Tour. Her dress also functions as a parachute, a single tap and hold on the screen while in the air will allow her to drift slowly to the ground. This is very useful on levels with lots of pits or air time.
