The M308 is my go-to ranged weapon for almost any encounter. It has high damage, solid accuracy and stability and rate of fire. While it suffers in the ammo department, this can be aided with the use of Fully Loaded and SureFire. I run it with The Bigger The Better Suppressor which, when combined with silencer skills, increases the damage output to ridiculous levels. I also use the Scope Mount, Jaeger Body, Military Laser Module and Solar Sight. Sights and lasers are interchangeable with whatever you prefer.
