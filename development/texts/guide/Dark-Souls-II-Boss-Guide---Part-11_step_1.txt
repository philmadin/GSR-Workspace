<h3>Demon of Song</h3> Another example of both a dangerous and simple boss. The Demon of Song is encountered singing in its domain. It won’t attack until you get close enough or hurt it. Once triggered, it will retreat into its shell and become invulnerable. The method to killing it is to drag it out of said shell and attack the ghostly face inside.

This boss does very high damage and can kill you very quickly, however it’s also an idiot. Don’t bother attacking the shell it lives in, you’ll just be repelled. Instead, let it get close and wait until it squirms out, revealing its true face, from here, let it perform whatever attack it wishes. Simply wait for it to finish flailing around, then attack its long arms and face. That’s it.

There are attacks to be cautious of, particularly a charging attack that it will do at range. It will appear to align itself on you and push off in a slide attempting to run you down. It can also raise itself high above you and try to body slam you. Both are tricky to avoid but early detection is the best cure. The Demon is also capable of firing water blasts at the player that are dangerous but again, they are easily avoidable as they go in a straight line. Finally he is capable of grabbing you and smashing you repeatedly into the ground so if it spreads its arms out wide move backwards quickly to avoid being fondled.

Felicia the Brave is ready to help from the third Bonfire. However there's a bit of a hike to the boss and she may die along the way, or be low health by the time you reach the boss.
