<h3>Champion Gundyr</h3>

The first attempt at this adversary was a learning experience. This time it's a slog of endurance. The fight starts out much the same as before but with a slightly more aggressive Gundyr. His attacks are similar but will require more caution as he can combo Halberd attacks with melee strikes and kicks.

The second half of the fight is where things kick off. Gundyr will power up, then put into effect a moveset design to constantly pressure you and break your guard. He will dart medium distances to slam into your shield, perform a powerful kick, combo his Halberd and generally push you to make mistakes. Just stick at it, wait for him to finish a combo, then attack, even if only once. Getting greedy will only earn you a stone boot to the face.

Remember that Katana wielding streaker at Firelink Shrine? Well, should you defeat him, his summon sign will be just outside the entrance to Champion Gundyr’s arena. Having an extra body to split Gundyr’s attention can be a huge boon. However, don’t let your ally do all the work as Gundyr may simply ignore him and hound you mercilessly. Luckily this time Gundyr doesn’t have a giant slug monster. Small mercies.
