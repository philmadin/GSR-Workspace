Top three images on homepage needs an update button. When editing the article there should be button 1, 2 and 3 to change the links on the homepage. 

Pending article holds the already published ones to edit. Could perhaps make a seperate collumn for editing the already finalised ones.

Slider feed right below the GSR logo isn't linking properly to the article. Clicking on the text feed just refreshes page.

Articles page not updating.

With the 'Latest Articles' on the home page, the 'See more' button isn't linked.
